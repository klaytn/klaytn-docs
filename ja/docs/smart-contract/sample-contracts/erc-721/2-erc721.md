# 2. Deploying Smart Contract <a id="2-deploying-smart-contract"></a>

You can use Klaytn IDE or use truffle to deploy above `MyERC721Card` smart contract.

## 2.1 Deploying smart contract using Klaytn IDE <a id="2-1-deploying-smart-contract-using-klaytn-ide"></a>

* Please visit the Klaytn IDE website and create a `MyERC721Card` contract. The complete source code was given at [Writing ERC-721 Smart Contract](1-erc721.md).
* Prepare your account which will be used to deploy the contract.
  * If you do not have an account yet, create one at [https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.com/create](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.com/create)
  * Get some test KLAY from the faucet - [https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.com/faucet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.com/faucet)
* Let's deploy `MyERC721Card.sol` as below.

Now `MyERC721Card` is live! You can mint and transfer cards which are ERC-721 compatible non-fungible tokens.

Let's mint two cards, i.e. `King` and `Queen` cards, for account `0x2645BA5Be42FfEe907ca8e9d88f6Ee6dAd8c1410` as below.

![ERC721-2-mint-king](./images/erc721-2-mint-king.png) ![ERC721-3-mint-queen](./images/erc721-3-mint-queen.png)

Now we have minted two cards and let's check the status of these `MyERC721Card` non-fungible token.

![ERC721-4-cards-status](./images/erc721-4-cards-status.png)

* `balanceOf` shows that account `0x2645BA5Be42FfEe907ca8e9d88f6Ee6dAd8c1410` has two cards.
* `cards` with parameter `1` shows that `MyERC721Card` with token ID `1` is a `Queen` of level 1.
* `ownerOf` with parameter `0` shows that owner of `MyERC721Card` with token ID `0` is `0x2645BA5Be42FfEe907ca8e9d88f6Ee6dAd8c1410`.

## 2.2 Deploying smart contract using truffle <a id="2-2-deploying-smart-contract-using-truffle"></a>

You should have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) in your environment. Please take a look at [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to install node.js using package manager in various environment.

```text
$ mkdir klaytn
$ cd klaytn
$ npm init # initialize npm at the erc20token directory
$ npm install truffle@4.1.15
$ npm install caver-js@latest # installing caver-js
$ ln -s node_modules/truffle/build/cli.bundled.js truffle
$ export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH
```

Now you have installed truffle and caver-js which are required to deploy smart contracts.

Let's prepare `truffle` and a smart contract `MyERC721Card.sol`.

```text
$ mkdir myerc721
$ cd myerc721
$ truffle init
```

Now you will have following directory structures.

```text
.
├── contracts
│   ├── Migrations.sol
├── migrations
│   └── 1_initial_migration.js
└── truffle-config.js
```

After write `MyERC721Card.sol` and locate it to `contracts` directory, directory structure will be as follows.

Now you will have following directory structures.

```text
.
├── contracts
│   ├── Migrations.sol
│   └── MyERC721Card.sol
├── migrations
│   └── 1_initial_migration.js
└── truffle-config.js
```

Also, edit `1_initial_migration.js` as shown below to deploy the `MyERC721Card` contract.

```javascript
const Migrations = artifacts.require("./Migrations.sol");
const MyERC721Card = artifacts.require("./MyERC721Card.sol");
module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(Migrations);
  deployer.deploy(MyERC721Card)
};
```

You also have to configure `truffle-config.js` to deploy the smart contract to Klaytn network. This is the same step described at [Deploying a Smart Contract using Truffle](../../../getting-started/quick-start/deploy-a-smart-contract.md#deploying-a-smart-contract-using-truffle)

```text
// truffle-config.js
module.exports = {
    networks: {
        baobab: {
            host: '127.0.0.1',
            port: 8551,
            from: '0xabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd', // enter your account address
            network_id: '1001', // Baobab network id
            gas: 20000000, // transaction gas limit
            gasPrice: 750000000000, // gasPrice of Baobab is 750 ston
        },
    },
    compilers: {
      solc: {
        version: "0.5.12"    // Specify compiler's version to 0.5.12
      }
  }
};
```

Now you are all ready, let's deploy `MyERC721Card.sol` using the following command.

```text
$ truffle deploy --network baobab --reset
Compiling ./contracts/MyERC721Card.sol...
Writing artifacts to ./build/contracts

Using network 'baobab'.

```

The console output shows that the transaction hash for deploying `MyERC721Card` is `0x1571e80552dab1d67260e8914e06d9b16ccae16fb698c750f6a09aab12517bc1` and the address of `MyERC721Card` is `0xc3d282926871c505f334d0f2c85ad52758347831`.
