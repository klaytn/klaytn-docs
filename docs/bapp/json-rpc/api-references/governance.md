# Governance

For the governance of the network, Klaytn provides the following APIs under `governance` namespace.

In Klaytn, there are three different governance modes.
* `none`: All nodes participating in the network have the right to change the configuration.
* `single`: Only one designated node has the right to change the configuration.
* `ballot`: All nodes which have voting power can vote for a change. When more than half of total voting power gathered, the vote passes.


## governance_vote

The `vote` method submits a new vote. If the node has the right to vote based on governance mode, the vote can be placed. If not, an error message will be returned and the vote will be ignored.

**Parameters**

- `Key` : Name of the configuration setting to be changed. Key has the form of `domain.field`
- `Value` : Various types of value for each key. 
  
| Key           | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|`"governance.governancemode"`| `STRING`. One of the three governance modes. `"none"`, `"single"`, `"ballot"`|
| `"governance.governingnode"`| `ADDRESS`. Designated governing node's address. It only works if the governance mode is `"single"` e.g.,`"0xe733cb4d279da696f30d470f8c04decb54fcb0d2"` |
| `"governance.unitprice"`| `NUMBER`. Price of unit gas. e.g., `25000000000`|
| `"governance.addvalidator"`| `ADDRESS`. Address of a new validator candidate. e.g., `0xe733cb4d279da696f30d470f8c04decb54fcb0d2`|
| `"governance.removevalidator"`| `ADDRESS`. Address of a current validator which need to be removed. e.g., `0xe733cb4d279da696f30d470f8c04decb54fcb0d2`|
|`"istanbul.epoch"` | `NUMBER`. A period in which votes are gathered in blocks. When an epoch end, all votes which haven't been passed will be cleared. e.g., `86400`|
| `"istanbul.committeesize"`| `NUMBER`. The number of validators in a committee.(`sub` in chain configuration) e.g., `7`|
| `"reward.mintingamount"`| `STRING`. Amount of Peb minted when a block is generated. Double quotation marks are needed for a value. e.g., `"9600000000000000000"` |
| `"reward.ratio"`| `STRING`. Distribution rate for a CN/PoC/KIR separated by `"/"`. The sum of all values has to be `100`. e.g., `"34/54/12"` meaning CN 34%, PoC 54%, KiR 12% |
| `"reward.useginicoeff"`| `BOOL`. Use the Gini coefficient or not. `true`, `false`|
| `"reward.deferredtxfee"`| `BOOL`. The way of giving transaction fee to a proposer. If true, it means the tx fee will be summed up with block reward and distributed to the proposer, KIR and PoC. If not, all tx fee will be given to the proposer. `true`, `false`|
| `"reward.minimumstake"`| `STRING`. Amount of Klay required to be a CN (Consensus Node). Double quotation marks are needed for a value. e.g., `"5000000"`|
