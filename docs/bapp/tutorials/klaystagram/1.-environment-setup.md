# 1. Environment Setup

## 1\) Install Node.js \(npm\)

> We recommend you install the latest Node LTS version for the `caver-js` compatibility.

* Download Node.js \(npm\) from the official site: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
* Install the package by clicking the download file.
* Type `$ node --version` in your terminal to verify `node` has been successfully installed.  

  ```text
    v10.16.0
  ```

⚠ At the time of writing, the latest LTS version that is compatible with `caver-js` is 10.16.0. If you have a higher node version, `caver-js` cannot be installed. Reinstall the node or use [NVM \(Node Version Manager\)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to set up a stable environment.

## 2\) Install Truffle

Truffle is a great tool for compiling and deploying contract files.

* Type `$ sudo npm install -g truffle` in your terminal to install the truffle.
* Type `$ truffle version` in your terminal to verify `truffle` has been installed successfully.  

  ```text
    Truffle v5.0.27
  ```

⚠ If the version is lower than 5, Install the truffle version 5.  
`$ sudo npm install -g truffle@5`
