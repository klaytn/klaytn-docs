## Introduction

![intro](images/tutorial-1intro.gif)

This tutorial is intended to give a step by step guide to build a Klaytn BApp. No previous Klaytn experience is needed. We will make a simple web app interacting with a basic smart contract, `Count`.  
Any user who has a Klaytn account can increase and decrease the current value as shown in the above gif.
