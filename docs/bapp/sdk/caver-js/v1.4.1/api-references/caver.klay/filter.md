## getFilterChanges <a id="getfilterchanges"></a>

```javascript
caver.klay.getFilterChanges(filterId [, callback])
```

Polling method for a filter, which returns an array of logs since the last poll.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| filterId | String | The filter id. |
| callback | Function | (optional) Optional callback, returns an error object as the first parameter and the result as the second. |

**Return Value**

``Promise`` returns ``Array`` - Array of log objects, or an empty array if nothing has changed since last poll.

The structure of the returned log ``Object`` in the ``Array`` looks as follows:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| address | 20-byte DATA | Address from which this log originated. |
| topics | Array of DATA | Array of 0 to 4 32-byte DATA of indexed log arguments. (In Solidity: The first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (*e.g.*, `Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)`), except you declared the event with the `anonymous` specifier.). |
| data | DATA | Contains the non-indexed arguments of the log. |
| blockNumber | QUANTITY | The block number where this log was in. `null` when pending. |
| transactionHash | 32-byte DATA | Hash of the transaction that this log was created from. `null` when pending, an edge case when the transaction has been executed, but the block has not been confirmed.  |
| transactionIndex | QUANTITY | Integer. The index of the transaction that this log was created from. `null` when pending. |
| blockHash | 32-byte DATA | Hash of the block where this log was in. `null` when pending. |
| logIndex | QUANTITY | Integer of the log index position in the block. `null` when it is a pending log. |
| id | String | A log identifier. It is made by concatenating "log_" string with `keccak256(blockHash + transactionHash + logIndex).substr(0, 8)` |

**Example**

```javascript
> caver.klay.getFilterChanges('0xafb8e49bbcba9d61a3c616a3a312533e').then(console.log);
