# Deploying Frontend code on IPFS using Fleek <a id="deploying-bmc-frontend-to-ipfs-using-fleek"></a>

Fleek is an infrastructure that enables us to build modern sites and apps on IPFS. With fleek your sites or app becomes permissionless, trustless, censorship resistant, and free of centralized gatekeepers. In this tutorial we will be deploying our Next js app to Fleek other than the traditional platforms like Vercel. 
Yeah you got it! We are deploying a decentralized application to a decentralized hosting platform! 

The following are the steps to deploy your BMC dApp to Fleek:

1. Make sure to confirm these configurations in your frontend code: 

    a. Open package.json and add in the following scripts:

    ```js
		"scripts": {
   		 "dev": "next",
   		 "build": "next build",
		  "start": "next start",
    		  "export": "next export"  
		}
	```
	b. Paste the code below in your next.config.js file in the root directory:

	```js
		module.exports = {
  			exportTrailingSlash: true,
		};
	```
