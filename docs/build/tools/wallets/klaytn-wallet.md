# Klaytn Wallet

Klaytn Wallet is a browser-based account management tool for dApp (decentralized application) developers on Klaytn. It helps developers create new accounts or view existing account information directly through a web browser without having to run a Klaytn node locally. Klaytn Wallet also lets users transfer KLAY or Klaytn tokens to other accounts for testing purposes.

## Create a New Account <a id="create-a-new-account"></a>

> If you already have a Klaytn ccount, you may choose to skip this process and go to [Access Existing Account](#access-existing-account).

You can use Klaytn Wallet to create new Klaytn accounts. To create a new account, click the `Create Account` button on the menu bar on the left, and then follow the steps below.

* Step 1. Set password for your new account's keystore file
* Step 2. Download the keystore file to your local storage
* Step 3. Save your new account's Klaytn Wallet Key

### Before continuing, a few words of caution: <a id="before-continuing-a-few-words-of-caution"></a>

* NEVER share your 'Wallet Key' or 'private key'  with anyone. Giving information about your 'Wallet Key' or 'private key' means giving away complete and permanent access to your account.
* Do not keep this information on a device connected to the Internet. Hackers can steal your credentials from your local storage.
* Choose a strong password and store critical information in multiple locations.
* Klaytn is UNABLE to restore 'Wallet Key' or 'private key' in case you lose it. Take utmost care not to lose your key information.

### Step 1. Set Password for your Keystore File <a id="step-1-set-password-for-your-keystore-file"></a>

As the first step in creating a new account, you must create a password for your keystore file. A keystore file is a JSON file that securely stores your Klaytn account information, including the account's address and the private key associated with the account. A keystore file's password must be strong enough to meet Klaytn's security standard, as the password protects the private key stored within the file.

When you click the password input form, a tooltip will appear above and it will show you, as you type in, if the entered password satisfies the security requirements. If your password meets all the requirements, `Next Step` button will be activated. ! 

### Step 2. Download the Keystore File <a id="step-2-download-the-keystore-file"></a>

In the second step, you download the keystore file that has been encrypted with the submitted password. Click the `Download & Next Step` button to immediately download the keystore file and move on to the last step. (Note that if the downloaded keystore file gets lost, you can download a new keystore file in the `View Account Info` menu.)

### Step 3. Save your Klaytn Wallet key and Private Key <a id="step-3-save-your-klaytn-wallet-key-and-private-key"></a>

In the final step, you are shown the Wallet Key and the private key corresponding to your newly created account. You are strongly encouraged to store the key in a separate, disconnected storage.

## Access Existing Account <a id="access-existing-account"></a>

To check your account's balance of KLAY or Klay tokens, or to transfer tokens to another account, you need to access your account. Klaytn Wallet offers two ways to access your account.

* **Using Klaytn Wallet Key or Private Key** A Klaytn Wallet Key is a string of 110 hexadecimal characters associated with an account, whereas a private key is a string of 64 hexadecimal characters (The character count does not include the "0x" prefixes that indicate hexadecimal numbers. If we count them in, a Klaytn Wallet Key is 112 characters long, and a private key is 66 characters long). Using one's private key should always be the last-ditch effort of access, only to be utilized when all else fails. This should not be the main road for anyone to access their accounts. Private keys are the most sensitive information because private keys allow complete access to an account. Therefore, it is extremely important to keep your private key safe, secure, and secret.
* **Keystore file and password** A keystore file is a JSON file that stores encrypted private key and account address information. This file is encrypted using the user-provided password.
