## Introduction
[Kaikas](https://docs.kaikas.io) is a blockchain wallet, similar to [Metamask](https://metamask.io), with additional support for Klaytn-specific [Transactions](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/docs/learn/transactions) & [Accounts](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/docs/learn/accounts). This article will guide you through integrating [Kaikas](https://docs.kaikas.io) with a decentralized application (dApp), from High-level (abstract) to Low-level (fine-grained) implementations. 

For the sake of this guide, we will be dividing Kaikas dApp integration into three main categories:

* UI Libraries
* Utility libraries
* Providers


:::note

The aforementioned libraries use `Providers` under the hood.

## 1. UI Libraries

Many dApps utilize frontend frameworks for state management & delivering reactive services. The recommended way to integrate Kaikas with such dApps is to use a UI Library built on the same framework.

UI Libraries provide components for user interactions, like `ConnectWallet` component. They also save you the hassle of managing low-level states, like Multiple Accounts & Multiple Networks. You can look at the underlying [Utility Library](#2-utility-libraries) or [Provider](#3-providers) for complex or low-level interactions.

While most UI libraries have built-in support for Metamask, integrating Kaikas is also easy since its [API](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/docs/references/json-rpc) is built on [Metamask's](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/json-rpc-api). Even if a library doesn't natively support Kaikas, extending it for Kaikas integration is straightforward. For example, these are 2 popular libraries for [React](https://react.dev) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org):

- [Web3Modal](#1.1-web3modal-example)
- [Web3-Onboard](#1.2-web3-onboard-example)

### 1.1 Web3Modal example

![Web3Modal Hero Banner](https://web3modal.com/images/hero-banner.png)

By [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com), [Web3Modal](https://web3modal.com) offers the following **Features:**

- Buttons + Modals for Connect Wallet, Account information, & Network information
- Support for [Email Wallets](https://walletconnect.com/blog/web3modal-web3-email-login-wallets), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) accounts, & [EIP-4361](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361)

**Considerations:**

- Using [@web3modal/wagmi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3modal/wagmi), you have to commit to their frontend stack of [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) & [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query)
- Requires a `projectId` [signup w/ WalletConnect](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in)

### 1.2 Web3-Onboard example

![Web3-Onboard Graphic](https://onboard.blocknative.com/_app/immutable/assets/connect-modal.b7439c5e.svg)

By [Blocknative](https://www.blocknative.com), [Web3-Onboard](https://onboard.blocknative.com) offers the following **Features:**

- Configurable Onboard text
- Modals for Connect Wallet, Switch Account, & Switch Network
- [Notification Components](https://onboard.blocknative.com/docs/modules/core#customnotification)
- (Optional) Register API Key(s) to fetch & render real-time data

**Considerations:**

- You'll have to write your Buttons

## 2. Utility Libraries

Libraries like [caver-js](#2.1-caver-js) & [ethers.js](#2.2-ethersjs-example) abstract just enough to streamline blockchain interactions while still being able to call [Provider](#3-providers) APIs directly.

Using Utility Libraries to connect an account or send native tokens (e.g., KLAY/ETH) will be no different, *in terms of syntax & lines of code*, from calling Providers directly. Where libraries mainly improve are in the following areas:

- Smart Contract interactions
  - These involve ABIs, encoding inputs, & decoding outputs. Without a library, the code for these can be verbose & error-prone.
- Error-handling
  - string error codes/messages are mapped to error Classes with custom properties & methods.
- Documentation & Type-safety

### 2.1 caver-js

[caver-js](https://github.com/klaytn/caver-js) provides first-party support for [Klaytn-specific methods](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/docs/references/json-rpc):

- Transaction, Account, & Account Key types
- Fee Delegation

Example Code: [kaikas-caverjs](https://github.com/klaytn/examples/tree/main/tools/wallet-libraries/kaikas-caverjs)

### 2.2 ethers.js example

[ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v6) is the [most popular](https://npmtrends.com/caver-js-vs-ethers-vs-viem-vs-web3) JavaScript Utility Library for interacting with the blockchain. It aims to be:

- Extensive: support for multiple wallet formats, languages, & functions
- Robust: comprehensive tests, documentation, & typing

## 3. Providers

At the lowest level is the Provider, [`window.klaytn`](https://docs.kaikas.io/02_api_reference/01_klaytn_provider) (Kaikas itself). You might prefer [Utility Libraries](#2-utility-libraries), but knowledge of Provider APIs helps debug & understand how dependent libraries work. Referring to [Klaytn's JSON-RPC API][Klaytn-API] is necessary for using Klaytn-specific methods like [`klay_getAccount`](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/docs/references/json-rpc/klay/get-account), [`klay_sendTransactionAsFeePayer`](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/docs/references/json-rpc/klay/send-transaction-as-fee-payer), & more.
