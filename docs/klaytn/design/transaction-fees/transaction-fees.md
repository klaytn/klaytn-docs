# Transaction Fees <a id="transaction-fees"></a>
The transaction fee for the current Klaytn virtual machine \(KLVM\) is calculated as follows:

```text
(Transaction Fee) := (Gas Used) * (Base Fee)
```

* The `Gas Used` is computed by KLVM based on the gas cost of the opcode and the intrinsic gas cost.
* `Base Fee` is the actual gas price used for the transaction. It has the same meaning as the `Effective Gas Price`.

This calculated transaction fee is subtracted from the sender's or fee payer's account balance, depending on the transaction.

## Gas and Base Fee Overview <a id="gas-and-base-fee-overview"></a>
### Gas <a id="gas"></a>
Every action that changes the state of the blockchain requires gas. When a node processes a user's transaction, such as sending KLAY, using KIP-7 tokens, or executing a contract, the user has to pay for the computation and storage usage. The payment amount is decided by the amount of `gas` required.

`Gas` is a measuring unit representing how much calculation is needed to process the user's transaction.

### Dynamic Gas Fee Mechanism <a id="dynamic-gas-fee-mechanism"></a>
Since Klaytn v1.9.0 hard fork, a dynamic gas fee mechanism has replaced the existing fixed fee policy. Dynamic gas fee policy provides a stable service to users by preventing network abuse and storage overuse. The gas fee changes according to the network situation. Seven parameters affect the `base fee(gas fee)`.

1. Previous base fee: Base fee of the previous block
2. Gas used for the previous block: Gas used to process all transactions of the previous block
3. Base gas: The gas amount that determines the increase/decrease of the base fee (30 million at the moment)
4. Maximum gas: The maximum gas amount used to calculate the base fee (60 million at the moment)
5. Adjustment value for fee range: Adjustment value for a fee range of base fee (20 at the moment)
6. Maximum base fee: The maximum value for the base fee (750 ston at the moment)
7. Minimum base fee: The minimum value for the base fee (25 ston at the moment)

### Base Fee <a id="base-fee"></a>
The basic idea of this algorithm is that the `base fee` would go up if the gas used exceeds the base gas and vice versa. It is closely related to the number of transactions in the network and the gas used in the process. There is an upper and lower limit for the `base fee` to prevent the fee from increasing or decreasing indefinitely. There is also a cap for the gas and an adjustment value for the fluctuation to prevent abrupt changes in the `base fee`. The values can be changed by governance.

```text
(Base fee change rate) = (Gas used for the previous block - Base gas)
(Adjusted base fee change rate) = (Base fee change rate) / (Base gas) / (Adjustment value for fee range)
(Base fee change range) = (Previous base fee) * (Adjusted base fee change rate)
(Base fee) = (Previous base fee) + (Base fee change range)
```

The `base fee` is calculated for every block; there could be changes every second. Transactions from a single block use the same `base fee` to calculate transaction fees. Only the transactions with a gas price higher than the block `base fee` can be included in the block. Half of the transaction fee for each block is burned.

> NOTE : An important feature that sets Klaytn apart from Ethereum's EIP-1559 is that it does not have tips. Klaytn follows the First Come, First Served(FCFS) principle for its transactions.

### Transaction Replacement <a id="transaction-replacement"></a>

Klaytn currently does not provide a way to replace a transaction using the unit price but may support different methods for the transaction replacement in the future. Note that in Ethereum, a transaction with a given nonce can be replaced by a new one with a higher gas price.

## Klaytn's Gas table  <a id="klaytns-gas-table"></a>

Basically, Klaytn is keeping compatibility with Ethereum. So Klaytn's gas table is pretty similar with that of Ethereum. But there are some features unique to Klaytn that require several new constants.

{% hint style="success" %}
NOTE: The gas table has changed with the `IstanbulEVM` protocol upgrade, or the "hard fork".
