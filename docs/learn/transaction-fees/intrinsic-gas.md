# Intrinsic Gas

Gas is a sum of `IntrinsicGas` and `ExecutionGas`. In here, we would focus on how `IntrinsicGas` is organized.

## Overview
A transaction's `intrinsicGas` can be calculated by adding up the next four factors.

```
IntrinsicGasCost = KeyCreationGas + KeyValidationGas + PayloadGas + TxTypedGas
```

* `PayloadGas` is calculated based on the size of the data field in the tx.
* `KeyCreationGas` is calculated when the transaction registers new keys. Only applicable in `accountUpdate` transaction.
* `KeyValidationGas` is calculated based on the number of signatures.
* `TxTypedGas` is defined based on the transaction types.

Before we get into the detail, keep in mind that not all key types apply the keyGases (`KeyCreationGas` and `KeyValidationGas`).

| Key Type | Are those keyGases applicable? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Nil | No |
| Legacy | No |
| Fail | No |
| Public | Yes |
| MultiSig | Yes |
| RoleBased | Depending on key types in the role |

## KeyCreationGas <a id="key-creation-gas"></a>
The KeyCreationGas is calculated as `(number of registering keys) x TxAccountCreationGasPerKey (20000)`.  
Please keep in mind that Public key type always has only one registering key, so the gas would be always 20000.

## KeyValidationGas <a id="key-validation-gas"></a>
`KeyValidationGas` is calculated as `(number of signatures - 1) x TxValidationGasPerKey(15000)`.  
Please keep in mind that Public key type always has only one signature key, so the gas would be always zero.

A Klaytn transaction can also have a feePayer, so the total KeyValidationGas is like this.

```
KeyValidationGas =  (KeyValidationGas for a sender) + (KeyValidationGas for a feePayer)
```

## PayloadGas <a id="payload-gas"></a>
Basically, `PayloadGas` is charged with `number_of_bytes_of_tx_input x TxDataGas (100)`. 

In the case of a transaction creating contract, an additional charge of `number_of_words_of_initcode x InitCodeWordGas (2)` is applied. It is effective since Shanghai hardfork.

## TxTypedGas <a id="tx-typed-gas"></a>
There are three types of transactions in klaytn; `base`, `feeDelegated`, and `feeDelegatedWithFeeRatio`.

For example,
* TxTypeValueTransfer is the `base` type of the valueTransaction transaction.
* TxTypeFeeDelegatedValueTransfer is a `feeDelegated` type of the valueTransfer transaction.
* TxTypeFeeDelegatedValueTransferWithRatio is a `feeDelegatedWithRatio` type of the valueTransfer transaction.

This is important when calculating TxTypedGas:
* First, check the TxType is `feeDelegated` or `feeDelegatedWithFeeRatio`.
    * If the TxType is `feeDelegated`, add `TxGasFeeDelegated(10000)` to TxTypedGas
    * If the TxType is `feeDelegatedWithFeeRatio`, add `TxGasFeeDelegatedWithRatio (15000)` to TxTypedGas
* Second, check the transaction creates contract or not.
    * If the transaction creates contract, add `TxGasContractCreation (53000)` to TxTypedGas.
    * Otherwise, add `TxGas (21000)` to TxTypedGas.

For example,
* If it's legacyTransaction and creates contract, the TxTypedGas would be `0 + TxGasContractCreation(53000)`.
* If it's TxTypeFeeDelegatedValueTransfer, the TxTypedGas would be `TxGasFeeDelegated(10000) + TxGas (21000)`
* If it's TxTypeFeeDelegatedSmartContractDeployWithRatio, the TxTypedGas would be `TxGasFeeDelegatedWithRatio (15000) + TxGasContractCreation (53000)`
