# Klaytn 2.0

## We Are Here to Give Power Back to the People <a id="klaytn2"></a>

In 2019, Kakao—one of South Korea’s leading software enterprises—created the Klaytn blockchain with the intention of staying true to its mission of making a better world through people and technology.

As an EVM Layer 1 blockchain, Klaytn is designed to be practical and reliable, focusing not just on technology and business, but also transformative change that will empower individuals in the age of Web3.

To that end, the Klaytn Foundation is committed to making blockchain technologies more accessible, to pave the way for more to be a part of the Web3 revolution, with Klaytn as the preferred trust layer that will connect people from all walks of life and all corners of the world.

To build the infrastructure for this collaborative Web3 playground, Klaytn will couple our robust community with powerful infrastructure technologies to discover new opportunities and accelerate the speed of innovation.

## We Are the Trust Layer of Metaverse <a id="trustlayer"></a>

The metaverse is poised to redefine society, by providing creators and players with a clean slate to define new standards and let their creativity flourish in our dynamic digital future.

This movement will begin with the underdogs, creative minds, youngsters, and outsiders—everyone who wants to be themselves without facing any prejudice.

This means that the metaverse should not be owned and operated by a central authority. It has to be a world where people are granted genuine ownership and the freedom to express their ideas without inhibition.

As an open source public blockchain project, Klaytn is built to be the fundamental trust layer for the metaverse, respecting the participation and contribution from all communities, empowering and bringing them together in the new world.
