It is clear that blockchain technology will serve as the critical trust layer for the metaverse.

However, between the fledgling state of blockchain tech and the difficulty of selecting the right tools and components, blockchain development is still filled with hurdles.

That’s why we put together an end-to-end package that’s designed to help builders of metaverse enter the blockchain world as smoothly as possible.

## Klaytn’s ‘Metaverse Package’ <a href="#klaytns-metaverse-package" id="klaytns-metaverse-package"></a>

Primary Infrastructure: Tool sets for end-to-end blockchain integration and building Customized L2 solution SDKs and smart contract libraries Wallets and chain explorers Distributed storage solutions Oracle support Bridges
