# Finality and Improvements

## Vast Improvements with uncompromised instant finality <a id="vast-improvements-with-uncompromised-finality"></a>

### 1-second Finality <a id="finality"></a>
Even with more consensus nodes, better performance and numerous feature enhancements, Klaytn will maintain 1-second block finality to ensure speedy transactions that will never be reversed.

### Throughput (TPS) <a id="throughput"></a>
Klaytn’s performance will be further boosted through a combination of network upgrades and layer 2 solutions, allowing it to handle a massive number of transactions.

### Scalability <a id="scalability"></a>
Klaytn 2.0 will address scalability through service chains, our easily customizable and deployable L2 solution. Other solutions, such as sharding or rollups, are also being planned for the future.

### Tiered Network <a id="tiered-network"></a>
Klaytn’s tiered structure delivers transactions to the consensus nodes effectively by distributing the workload for greater stability. Our nodes are also continuously fortified to ensure seamless operation.

### Interoperability <a id="interoperability"></a>
Various ecosystems (such as DEX, Bridge, Oracle, etc) will flourish on Klaytn. The asset transfer or exchange between Klaytn and other blockchains will be much easier.

### User Experience <a id="user-experience"></a>
Klaytn delivers a superior end-user experience by providing fast transaction processing suitable for mobile environments, the ability to update exposed keys to mitigate risks, and fee delegation to transfer the transaction fee burden.

### Developer Experience <a id="developer-experience"></a>
Klaytn supports Ethereum equivalence, which provides access to the complete stack of Ethereum development tools and enables effortless migration of Ethereum projects. In addition, fast and inexpensive multi-signature functionality is also supported at a protocol level without requiring a smart contract implementation.
