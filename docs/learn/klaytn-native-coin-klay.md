# Klaytn native coin - KLAY

## KLAY <a id="klay"></a>

KLAY is the main internal transferable cryptocurrency of Klaytn and is used to pay transaction fees when creating or executing smart contracts or when transferring KLAY.

KLAY is a necessary element--a fuel--for operating the Klaytn distributed application platform. It is a form of payment made by the clients of the platform to the consensus nodes \(CNs\) executing the requested operations. To put it another way, KLAY is an incentive; it ensures that developers write high-quality applications \(wasteful code costs more\) and that the network remains healthy \(CNs are compensated for the resources they contribute\).
