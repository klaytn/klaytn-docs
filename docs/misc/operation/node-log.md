## Error Logs

| Log Type | Node Type | Log Message | Description | Suggested Guide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Blockchain | CN/PN/EN |########## BAD BLOCK #########Chain config: %v<br/><br/>Number: %vHash: 0x%x%v<br/><br/>Error: %v############################## | A bad block occurs when the received receipt and the execution result do not match. If a node stops with bad block log, it could be due to two reasons.  <br/>- Case 1. The configuration of the node is wrong such, as the binary version.  <br/>- Case 2. There’s a problem with the code. It is very likely that other nodes will also experience the same problem. | This error is critical, so if you see any bad block, please make an issue or report it to the Klaytn GitHub repository. |
| ConsensusIstanbulCore | CN/PN/EN | **Drop an empty message from timeout channel** | It means that the round change timer will expire. This error is printed if the timer closes accidentally. | The error may occur when the downloader is started.  check next log is also printed: `Block synchronisation started`. |
| NetworksP2P | CN/PN/EN | **Protocol istanbul/64 failed** id=04680a827fa1b240 conn=staticdial err="write tcp 10.117.2.105:34396->10.117.2.27:32323: use of closed etwork connection" <br/><br/>**Protocol istanbul/64 failed** err="shutting down" | This log can be printed when the other node is disconnected. It is usually followed by `Disconnected a P2P Peer` log. | Check if the disconnected peer is reconnected again. If it is not reconnected, check the network status or peer connection [admin_peers](../../../references/json-rpc/admin/peers) |
| NodeCN | CN | **fail to SendNewBlockHashes** err="write tcp 10.117.2.124:24108->10.117.2.108:32323: use of closed network connection"  <br/><br/>**fail to SendNewBlockHashes** err="shutting down" | same as `Protocol istanbul/64 failed` | same as `Protocol istanbul/64 failed` |
| NodeCN | CN | **fail to SendNewBlock** peer=d35220eccdb0de7b err="shutting down" | same as `Protocol istanbul/64 failed` | same as `Protocol istanbul/64 failed` | 
| NetworksRPC | EN (mostly) | **FastWebsocketHandler fail to upgrade message** error="websocket: version != 13" | Version issue of WebSocket connection | The header of the request should contain `Sec-Websocket-Version` field with the value set at 13. You may not have used klaytn rpc client. |

## Warn Logs

| Log Type | Node Type | Log Message | Description | Suggested Guide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Blockchain | CN/PN/EN | **Upgrade database version** from=N/A to=3 | It is logged at the beginning of the node start-up | You don't need to handle this. |
| ConsensusIstanbulCore | CN | **[RC]** round= | Round change log is started with [RC] tag. | If the round does not end in one or two rounds and continues to go up, then the network status or peer connection should be analyzed first.  peer connection check api: [admin_peers](../../../references/json-rpc/admin/peers)|
| ConsensusIstanbulCore | CN | **unexpected request**  address= state="Accept request" seq=312 err="old message" number=311 hash=d960ea…6df6de | A proposer mines a block, but it is turned out unexpected. In most cases, it is too old to be a new block. | You don't need to handle this. |
| Node | CN/PN/EN | **Failed doConnTypeHandshake** addr=10.117.2.252:28516 conn=inbound conntype=-1 err="read tcp 10.117.2.78:32324->10.117.2.252:28516: i/o timeout | By dialing, the two P2P peers setup a connection. This log is printed if the setup fails. | Check if the disconnected peer is reconnected again. If not, check the network status or peer connection  peer connection check api: [admin_peers](../../../references/json-rpc/admin/peers) |
| NodeCN | PN/EN | **Failed to filter bodies** peer=c02e4b4d471c56b9 lenTxs=1 | A node received the unwanted block header of body when fetching.  - lenTxs: non-requested number of txs | You don't need to handle this. |
| Work | CN | **Transaction aborted due to time limit** hash= | The block execution time when mining should not exceed 250ms, so the last transaction can be aborted due to this time limit. | Confirm that the transaction enters the block. |
| Work | CN | **Transaction failed, account skipped** hash=b1b26c...6b220a err="insufficient balance for transfer"<br/><br/>Error(before v1.6.2)<br/>Warn(after v1.6.2) | When a transaction cannot be executed during mining due to an insufficient balance in the `from` account  (Theoretically, it occurs when the balance was sufficient at the time when the transaction was created and entered the txpool, but not at the actual execution time.) | Check if the `from` account is really out of balance. |

## Info Logs

`Info` log contains the additional information for you to know more about the node status, so you don't need to handle `Info` level log.

| Log Type | Node Type | Log Message | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Blockchain | CN/PN/EN | **Regenerated local transaction journal** transactions=0 accounts=0 | When node is shut down, local txs are journaled to a file (default file name is transactions.rlp). When node is restarted with the journaled file, the local transactions can be regenerated based on the file.  - transactions: number of the regenerated local transaction.  - accounts: number of the regenerated accounts(==from) |
| Blockchain | CN/PN/EN| **Inserted a new block** number=14 hash=13cbfc…f007fc txs=0 gas=0 elapsed=793.458µs  processTxs=167ns finalize=157.708µs validateState=7.542µs totalWrite=443.417µs trieWrite=256.667µs | If the node is not a proposer at that block, and the consensus is successful, the node have executed(==validates) the block. In other words, a block is inserted.  - gas: total gas spent during tx execution.  This field is commonly used when testing the network to find the used gas per block. |
| NetworksP2P | CN/PN/EN | **[Dial] Add dial candidate from static nodes**  id=62a08a4b9f091c4b NodeType=0 ip=10.117.2.8 mainPort=32323 port=[32323] | A new P2P peer is connected, and it is a static node. A node added manually by using static-nodes.json or addpeer api is called static node. If it is a multichannel, it uses two ports. ex. [32323, 32324].  - id: dst peer id  - NodeType: dst node type(cn,pn,en,bn)  - ip: dst ip  - mainPort: dst TCP listening port number  - port: dst TCP listening port number including both the main port and sub port.|
| NetworksP2P | CN/PN/EN | **Added a multichannel P2P Peer** id=28a6760472a078fb conn=staticdial peerID=28a6760472a078fb | A new peer is connected as a multichannel peer.  - id/peerID: my node’s peer id  - conn: type of connection  - inbound: somebody connects me  - staticdial: static connection, such as static-nodes.json or addPeer  - trusteddial: trusted connection, such as trust-nodes.json. it can be always reconnected and established even the number of connections exceeds max limit.|
| NetworksP2P | CN/PN/EN | **Disconnected a multichannel P2P Peer** id=28a6760472a078fb conn=inbound    peerID=28a6760472a078fb peerName=Klaytn/v1.7.3+acae89350c/darwin-arm64/go1.18.1 err=EOF | A multichannel peer is disconnected.  - peerName: It shows my node info  - err: The reason why the connection is disconnected |
| NetworksP2P | CN/PN/EN | **ProtocolManager.processConsensusMsg closed** id=28a6760472a078fb conn=inbound    PeerName=Klaytn/v1.7.3+acae89350c/darwin-arm64/go1.18.1 | When a P2P node is disconnected, the consensus message channel between them is closed, too. |
| StorageStateDB | CN/PN/EN | **Persisted trie from memory database** blockNum=23460 updated nodes=4 updated nodes size=499.00B time=539.959µs  gcnodes=68  gcsize=10.55kB gctime=226.499µs  livenodes=245 livesize=37.80kB | This log is printed to inform you that trie db has been committed. Here, commit means flushing db change to the actual db.  A commit is made periodically.  - Case 1. If the node is a full node, trie commit is made for every 128 block.  - Case 2. If the node is an archive node, trie commit is made for every block.  Commit is made at next circumstances, too.  - , A commit is made when a node is shut down.  - A commit is made when memory size exceeds the cap.  Tip.  - gc stands for garbage collection. Here, garbage collection means flushing db writes of trie node change.  - A full node stores the information of every 128 cycle and the latest 128 blocks.  - Archive node stores the information of every block.|
| Work | CN | **Commit new mining work** number=14 hash=438ef7…68ca7f txs=0 elapsed=605.375µs commitTime=184.708µs finalizeTime=414.375µs | Every CN mines a block in preparation for round change - number: block number - hash: block hash (it is not a final version)  - txs: number of transactions in a block - elapsed: total block mining time (commitTime + finalizeTime) - commitTime: transactions execution time in a block - finalizeTime: block finalize time  |
| Work | CN | **Successfully sealed new block** number=14 hash=13cbfc…f007fc | [Only Proposer] Sealing a new block is successful. Sealing contains the next steps.  - Ibft consensus process for the block.  - Update timestamp and signatures of the block |
| Work | CN | **Successfully wrote mined block** num=14 hash=13cbfc…f007fc txs=0 elapsed=617.709µs | [Only Proposer] If the node is a proposer, and consensus is succeed, the proposer needs to store the block execution result in the db. This log means the storing was successful. | 
| Work | CN | **Mining too far in the future** wait=1s | In order to maintain 1 second block creation period, the node sleeps for "1s - previous block generation/propagation/execution time".  - wait: how much time the node sleeps|
| VM | CN/PN/EN | **Returning since the addr is not a program account** addr= | Somebody tries to call a non-existent contract.  Tip. In Klaytn, program account is equivalent to contract account. |
