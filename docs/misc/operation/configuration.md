# Configuration

This document explains the configurable properties of the node. Klaytn node package ships with good defaults and requires very little configuration. If you changed any settings of a running node, you must restart the node to reflect the changes.

## CN Configuration File location <a id="cn-configuration-file-location"></a>

* `kcnd.conf` for configuring the Consensus Node

The configuration file is located in the `conf` directory, whose default location depends on whether or not the installation is from an archive distribution \(`tar.gz`\) or a package distribution \(RPM\).

* For the archive distribution, the config directory location defaults to `$INSTALL_PATH/kcn-linux-amd64/conf/`.
* For the package distribution, the config directory defaults to `/etc/kcnd/conf/`.

## PN Configuration File location <a id="pn-configuration-file-location"></a>

* `kpnd.conf` for configuring the Proxy Node

The configuration file is located in the `conf` directory, whose default location depends on whether or not the installation is from an archive distribution \(`tar.gz`\) or a package distribution \(RPM\).

* For the archive distribution, the config directory location defaults to `$INSTALL_PATH/kpn-linux-amd64/conf/`.
* For the package distribution, the config directory defaults to `/etc/kpnd/conf/`.

## EN Configuration File location <a id="configuration-file-location"></a>

* `kend.conf` for configuring the Endpoint Node

The configuration file is located in the `conf` directory, whose default location depends on whether or not the installation is from an archive distribution \(`tar.gz`\) or a package distribution \(RPM\).

* For the archive distribution, the config directory location defaults to `$INSTALL_PATH/ken-linux-amd64/conf/`.
* For the package distribution, the config directory defaults to `/etc/kend/conf/`.


## Configuration File Format  <a id="configuration-file-format"></a>

CN and PN have the same configuration file format and the properties. 

Below is a sample configuration file for the CN that participates in the `cypress` network and stores the blockchain data in the default location, which is `~/kcnd_home` with the archive distribution, `/var/kcnd/data` with the package distribution.

```text
# Configuration file for the kcnd

# cypress, baobab is only available if you don't specify NETWORK_ID.
NETWORK="cypress"
# if you specify NETWORK_ID, a private network is created.
NETWORK_ID=
PORT=32323
SERVER_TYPE="fasthttp"
SYNCMODE="full"
VERBOSITY=3
MAXCONNECTIONS=100
# LDBCACHESIZE=10240
REWARDBASE="0x0"

...

DATA_DIR=
LOG_DIR=$DATA_DIR/logs
```

The recommended txpool sizes for CN are as follows. 

```text
TXPOOL_EXEC_SLOTS_ALL=16384
TXPOOL_NONEXEC_SLOTS_ALL=16384
TXPOOL_EXEC_SLOTS_ACCOUNT=16384
TXPOOL_NONEXEC_SLOTS_ACCOUNT=16384
```

The recommended txpool sizes for PN are as follows.

```text
TXPOOL_EXEC_SLOTS_ALL=8192
TXPOOL_NONEXEC_SLOTS_ALL=8192
TXPOOL_EXEC_SLOTS_ACCOUNT=8192
TXPOOL_NONEXEC_SLOTS_ACCOUNT=8192
```

The recommended txpool sizes for EN are as follows.

```text
TXPOOL_EXEC_SLOTS_ALL=4096
TXPOOL_NONEXEC_SLOTS_ALL=4096
TXPOOL_EXEC_SLOTS_ACCOUNT=4096
TXPOOL_NONEXEC_SLOTS_ACCOUNT=4096
```

## Properties <a id="properties"></a>

The configuration file has the following configurable properties. CN and PN configuration files have the same properties except `REWARDBASE.`

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| NETWORK | Network name that this node will join.  This value is used when NETWORK_ID is not defined.  ("cypress", "baobab") |
| NETWORK_ID | Klaytn network ID.  If you create a local private network, you will define the network ID for your own.  Following IDs are reserved for pre-configured networks. <br/>8217 : Cypress (Main network) <br/>1000 : Aspen test network <br/>1001 : Baobab test network |

| MAXCONNECTIONS | Maximum number of physical connections.  All single-channel peers can have up to MAXCONNECTIONS peers.  All multi-channel peers can have up to MAXCONNECTIONS/2 peers.  Network connection is disabled if it is set to 0. (Default: 10) |
| LDBCACHESIZE | Size of in-memory cache in LevelDB (MiB). (Default : 768) |
| REWARDBASE | Account address that will receive block consensus rewards. This property only applies to CN. |
| TXPOOL_EXEC_SLOTS_ALL | Maximum number of executable transaction slots for all accounts. (Default: 4096) |
| TXPOOL_NONEXEC_SLOTS_ALL | Maximum number of non-executable transaction slots for all accounts. (Default: 1024) |
| TXPOOL_EXEC_SLOTS_ACCOUNT | Number of executable transaction slots guaranteed per account. (Default: 16) |
| TXPOOL_NONEXEC_SLOTS_ACCOUNT | Maximum number of non-executable transaction slots guaranteed per account. (Default: 64) |
| TXPOOL_LIFE_TIME | Maximum amount of time non-executable transactions is queued. (Default : 5m) |
| RPC_ENABLE | Enable the HTTP-RPC server if it is set to 1. |
| RPC_API | Comma-separated list of APIs offered over the HTTP-RPC interface.  (admin, debug, klay, miner, net, personal, rpc, txpool, web3) |
| RPC_PORT | HTTP-RPC server listening port. (Default: "8551") |
| RPC_ADDR | HTTP-RPC server listening interface. (Default: "localhost") |
| RPC_CORSDOMAIN | Comma-separated list of domains from which to accept cross-origin requests (browser enforced) |
