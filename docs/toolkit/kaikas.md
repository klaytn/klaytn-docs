## PC web browser based decentralized HD wallet

Kaikas is a web browser extension available in Chrome and Firefox. Kaikas is optimized for the desktop environment.

Kaikas requires users to manage their own accounts and keys. All transactions are transparently recorded on the Klaytn blockchain, so anybody can access the transaction history by using [Klaytnscope].

Kaikas is a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet, meaning that it generates a hierarchical tree-like structure of private/public keys indefinitely from a single seed phrase. The seed phrase consists of mnemonic code words, which makes it easier to remember than phrases made of random alphanumerics. Users' private keys are encrypted and stored in each user's own browser.

With the features described above, Kaikas has improved the security, transparency, and user-friendliness of the current blockchain experience. However, it is vital that users be responsible for their personal account management (i.e., if a user does not remember his/her seed phrase, there is no other way to restore his/her accounts.)

## Supporting various Klaytn networks and tokens

Kaikas allows you to store and transact with all Klaytn-based tokens including KLAY. Tokens that are not loaded by default can be inserted by pasting in their contract address. You can even store and transact your own Klaytn-based custom tokens on Kaikas!

Kaikas supports Klaytn's Baobab testnet as well as the Cypress mainnet. Moreover, those developing their own Klaytn-based blockchain applications may connect to their private networks to send and receive the tokens.

## Signing web-based BApp transactions

Kaikas can be connected with web-based Klaytn BApps. You can use your Kaikas account to sign transactions/data presented to you by the applications.

Kaikas can also be used to handle fee delegation. By using Kaikas, BApp develops and operators can sign the fee transactions.
