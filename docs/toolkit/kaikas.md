## PC web browser based decentralized HD wallet

Kaikas is a web browser extension available in Chrome and Firefox. Kaikas is optimized for the desktop environment.

Kaikas offers easy, integrated management of user accounts and keys. All transactions are transparently recorded on the Klaytn blockchain, so anybody can access the transaction history by using [Klaytnscope].

Kaikas is a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet, meaning that it generates a hierarchical tree-like structure of private/public keys indefinitely from a single seed phrase. The seed phrase consists of mnemonic code words, which makes it easier to remember than phrases made of random alphanumerics. Users' private keys are encrypted and stored in their browsers.

With the features described above, Kaikas has improved the security, transparency, and user-friendliness of the current blockchain experience. However, it is vital for users to be responsible for managing their personal accounts. For example, if a user couldn't remember his/her seed phrase, there would be no other way to restore his/her accounts.

## Supporting various Klaytn networks and tokens

Kaikas enables you to store and interact with all Klaytn-based tokens, including KLAY and your own custom tokens. Tokens that are not shown up in Kaikas can later be added by pasting in their token contract address.

Kaikas supports Klaytn's Baobab testnet as well as the Cypress mainnet. Moreover, Kaikas supports the private chains for Klaytn-based blockchain application developers who may wish to circulate custom tokens in their private network.

## Signing web-based BApp transactions

Kaikas simply bridges the gap between you and Klaytn BApps, empowering you to sign transactions/data flowing to you from BApps with Kaikas account.
Kaikas is also an aidful utility for developers to handle [fee-delegated transactions](/docs/klaytn/design/transactions/README.md#fee-delegation). Using Kaikas, both transaction senders and fee payers can swiftly sign the fee-delegated transactions.
