## PC web browser based decentralized HD wallet

Kaikas is a web browser extension available in Chrome and Firefox. Kaikas is optimized for the desktop environment.

Kaikas offers an easy, integrated management of user accounts and keys. All transactions are transparently recorded on the Klaytn blockchain, so anybody can access the transaction history by using [Klaytnscope].

Kaikas is a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet, meaning that it generates a hierarchical tree-like structure of private/public keys indefinitely from a single seed phrase. The seed phrase consists of mnemonic code words, which makes it easier to remember than phrases made of random alphanumerics. Users' private keys are encrypted and stored in each browser of them.

With the features described above, Kaikas has improved the security, transparency, and user-friendliness of the current blockchain experience. However, it is vital for users to be responsible for managing their own personal account. For example, if a user couldn't remember his/her seed phrase, there would be no other way to restore his/her accounts.

## Supporting various Klaytn networks and tokens

Kaikas enables you to store and interact with all Klaytn-based tokens, including KLAY and your own custom tokens. Tokens that are not shown up in Kaikas can be added by pasting in their token contract address.

Kaikas supports Klaytn's Baobab testnet as well as the Cypress mainnet. Moreover, Kaikas supports the private chains for Klaytn-based blockchain application developers who may access their own net and circulate their tokens in it.

## Signing web-based BApp transactions

Kaikas also serves as the bridge between you and web-based Klaytn BApps. You can sign transactions, including transactions with data and fee delegated transactions, brought to you from BApps.
