# Transaction

## klay_call <a id="klay_call"></a>

Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the block chain. It returns data or an error object of JSON RPC if error occurs.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| callObject | Object | The transaction call object.  See the next table for the object's properties. |
| blockNumberOrHash | QUANTITY &#124; TAG &#124; HASH| Integer or hexadecimal block number, or the string `"earliest"`, `"latest"` or `"pending"` as in the [default block parameter](./block.md#the-default-block-parameter), or block hash.|

:::note
 
NOTE: In versions earlier than Klaytn v1.7.0, only integer block number, the string `"earliest"` and `"latest"` are available.

:::

`callObject` has the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| from | 20-byte DATA | (optional) The address the transaction is sent from. |
| to | 20-byte DATA | (optional when testing the deployment of a new contract) The address the transaction is directed to. |
| gas | QUANTITY | (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. `klay_call` consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. |
| gasPrice | QUANTITY | (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas. |
| value | QUANTITY | (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction. |
| input | DATA | (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. It replaces `data` field, but `data` field is still supported for backward compatibility.  |

**Return Value**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DATA | The return value of executed contract. |

If you deployed a contract, use [klay_getTransactionReceipt](#klay_gettransactionreceipt) to get the contract address.

**Error**

It returns an error object of JSON RPC if anything goes wrong.
For example, an error object with a message  "evm: execution reverted" will be generated if a message call is terminated with `REVERT` opcode.

**Example**

```shell
// Request
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "klay_call", "params": [{"from": "0x3f71029af4e252b25b9ab999f77182f0cd3bc085", "to": "0x87ac99835e67168d4f9a40580f8f5c33550ba88b", "gas": "0x100000", "gasPrice": "0x5d21dba00", "value": "0x0", "input": "0x8ada066e"}, "latest"], "id": 1}' https://public-en-baobab.klaytn.net

// Result

```

## klay_estimateGas <a id="klay_estimategas"></a>

Generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete. The transaction will not be added to the blockchain. Note that the estimate may be significantly more than the amount of gas actually used by the transaction, for a variety of reasons including Klaytn Virtual Machine mechanics and node performance.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| callObject | Object | The transaction call object.  See the next table for the object's properties. |

`callObject` has the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| from | 20-byte DATA | (optional) The address the transaction is sent from. |
| to | 20-byte DATA | (optional when testing the deployment of a new contract) The address the transaction is directed to. |
| gas | QUANTITY | (optional) Integer of the upper gas limit provided for the gas estimation. If no gas limit is specified, the Klaytn node uses the designated gas limit as an upper bound.  
| gasPrice | QUANTITY | (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas. |
| value | QUANTITY | (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction. |
| input | DATA | (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. It replaces `data` field, but `data` field is still supported for backward compatibility.  |

**Return Value**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| QUANTITY | The amount of gas used. |


**Example**
```shell
// Request
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "klay_estimateGas", "params": [{"from": "0x3f71029af4e252b25b9ab999f77182f0cd3bc085", "to": "0x87ac99835e67168d4f9a40580f8f5c33550ba88b", "gas": "0x100000", "gasPrice": "0x5d21dba00", "value": "0x0", "input": "0x8ada066e"}], "id": 1}' https://public-en-baobab.klaytn.net

// Result
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0","id":1,
  "result": "0x5208" // 21000
}
```

## klay_estimateComputationCost <a id="klay_estimatecomputationcost"></a>

Generates and returns an estimate of how much computation cost will be spent to execute the transaction.
Klaytn limits the computation cost of a transaction to `100000000` currently not to take too much time by a single transaction.
The transaction will not be added to the blockchain like [klay_estimateGas](#klay_estimategas).

**Parameters**

See [klay_call](#klay_call) parameters, except that all properties are optional.
If no gas limit is specified, the Klaytn node uses the default gas limit (uint64 / 2) as an upper bound.

**Return Value**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| QUANTITY | The amount of computation cost used. |

**Example**
```shell
// Request
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"klay_estimateComputationCost","params":[{"from":"0x73718c4980728857f3aa5148e9d1b471efa3a7dd", "to":"0x069942a3ca0dabf495dba872533134205764bc9c", "value":"0x0", "input":"0x2a31efc7000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000271000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000420000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003039"}, "latest"],"id":1}' https://public-en-baobab.klaytn.net

## txError: Detailed Information of Transaction Failures <a id="txerror-detailed-information-of-transaction-failures"></a>

Klaytn provides a field `txError` in the transaction receipt
to give developers more information about the reason for the failed transaction execution.
This field exists only if the transaction execution is failed.
To save storage and network bandwidth, `txError` contains an integer value.
The below table shows the meaning of the value in `txError`.

| Error Code | Description |
|---|---|
|0x02|VM error occurs while running smart contract|
|0x03|max call depth exceeded|
|0x04|contract address collision|
|0x05|contract creation code storage out of gas|
|0x06|evm: max code size exceeded|
|0x07|out of gas|
|0x08|evm: write protection|
|0x09|evm: execution reverted|
|0x0a|reached the opcode computation cost limit (100000000) for tx|
|0x0b|account already exists|
|0x0c|not a program account (e.g., an account having code and storage)|
|0x0d|Human-readable address is not supported now|
|0x0e|fee ratio is out of range [1, 99]|
|0x0f|AccountKeyFail is not updatable|
|0x10|different account key type|
|0x11|AccountKeyNil cannot be initialized to an account|
|0x12|public key is not on curve|
|0x13|key weight is zero|
|0x14|key is not serializable|
|0x15|duplicated key|
|0x16|weighted sum overflow|
|0x17|unsatisfiable threshold. Weighted sum of keys is less than the threshold.|
|0x18|length is zero|
|0x19|length too long|
|0x1a|nested composite type|
|0x1b|a legacy transaction must be with a legacy account key|
|0x1c|deprecated feature|
|0x1d|not supported|
|0x1e|smart contract code format is invalid|

## klay_getDecodedAnchoringTransactionByHash <a id="klay_getDecodedAnchoringTransactionByHash"></a>

Returns the decoded anchored data in the transaction for the given transaction hash.

**Parameters**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 32-byte DATA | Hash of a transaction. |

**Return Value**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BlockHash | 32-byte DATA | Hash of the child chain block that this anchoring transaction was performed. |
| BlockNumber | QUANTITY | The child chain block number that this anchoring transaction was performed. |
| ParentHash | 32-byte DATA | Hash of the parent block. |
| TxHash | 32-byte DATA | The root of the transaction trie of the block. |
| StateRootHash | 32-byte DATA | The root of the final state trie of the block. |
| ReceiptHash| 32-byte DATA | The root of the receipts trie of the block. |
| BlockCount | QUANTITY | The number of blocks generated during this anchoring period. In most cases, this number is equal to the child chain's `SC_TX_PERIOD`, with the exception of the case that this transaction was the first anchoring tx after turning on the anchoring. |
| TxCount | QUANTITY | The number of transactions generated in the child chain during this anchoring period. |
