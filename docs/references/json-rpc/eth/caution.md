# Cautions when using eth namespace APIs in Klaytn.

Klaytn supports `eth` namespace APIs, so developers using Ethereum based SDKs or tools now can easily migrate their
existing projects to Klaytn.
(e.g. You can replace the endpoint URL in the Ethereum tools to point to a Klaytn node.)

But due to the fundamental design differences existing between Klaytn and Ethereum,
some APIs cannot be fully supported. (e.g. some fields have always zero value)

This document describes the limitations of those APIs.

## Block Header <a id="block_header"></a>

Related APIs: [eth_getHeaderByNumber](./block.md#eth_getheaderbynumber), [eth_getHeaderByHash](./block.md#eth_getheaderbyhash).

* Please read the description :warning: carefully.

| baseFeePerGas         | (added)                 | :warning: This field always has the value `0x0` because Klaytn does not have a baseFeePerGas scheme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This is because Klaytn's consensus mechanism is not based on PoW, indicating the technical concept of block difficulty is not applicable to Klaytn core.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| extraData             | extraData               | :warning: This field always has the value `0x` indicating the empty value.

There are lots of transaction types in Klaytn, and fields of data structure vary based on the type.

So you have to check how various types of Klaytn transaction are converted as Ethereum transaction because
during converting process some fields are omitted or added with zero or dummy values. That means
Some important information(in terms of Klaytn) will be lost during converting.

Please note that we define EthereumLegacyTransaction in this document as the Ethereum transaction format before [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718).

When you try to query Klaytn transactions via eth namespace JSON-RPC apis, Klaytn transactions will be
return as Ethereum Legacy Transaction type.

This document describes the details of converting process (Klaytn transactions -> Ethereum Legacy Transaction).

### Common Fields

Regardless of various Klaytn transaction type, there are common fields.
This section describes how that common fields are served as Ethereum Legacy Transaction.

## Transaction Receipt <a id="transaction_receipt"></a>

Related APIs: [eth_getTransactionReceipt](./transaction.md#eth_gettransactionreceipt).

By default, the fields in the Klaytn Transaction Receipt are different depending on the transaction type.
Because there are lots of transaction types in Klaytn, fields of transaction receipt vary based on the transaction type.

When you try to query Klaytn transaction receipts via eth namespace JSON-RPC apis,
Klaytn TransactionReceipt will be returned as Ethereum Transaction Receipt.

This document describes the details of converting process (Klaytn Transaction Receipt -> Ethereum Transaction Receipt).

* Please read the description :warning: carefully.
* The :white_check_mark: icon in the description denotes that the field used in the same way as in Ethereum.

### Common Fields

Regardless of various Klaytn transaction type, there are common fields.
(Please remind that fields of Klaytn Transaction Receipt are various based on transaction types.)

This section describes how that common fields are served as Ethereum Transaction Receipt.
