# We Are Here to Give Power Back to the People <a id="klaytn2"></a>

The South Korean Web2 giant Kakao created the most practical, reliable EVM Layer 1 blockchain network Klaytn.
Staying true to its mission to "make a better world with people and technology", the Klaytn blockchain gives power back to the people in the age of Web3, rather than focusing solely on technology and business. 
To that end, the Klaytn Foundation is committed to making cutting-edge technologies more accessible, to pave the way to engage more people to partake in this new experience.

A robust community based on trust coupled with powerful technologies that support infrastructure will help Klaytn and its participants build a collaborative playground for a new, exciting world of Web3. This will allow the Klaytn Foundation to discover new opportunities and accelerate the speed of innovation reaching mainstream.
Web3 is where people group together in flexible affiliations based on common interest, and the millennials and zoomers are emerging as the main actors that willingly embrace what it has to offer. Klaytn Network will be the best trust layer to accommodate these members of the next generation.

# We Are the Trust Layer of Metaverse <a id="trustlayer"></a>

With the approaching of a new civilization, the metaverse is emerging as a space for creators and players to define new standards, where a dynamic, digital future with flourishing creativity awaits.

This movement will begin with the underdogs, creative minds, youngsters, outsiders - whoever that wants to be themselves without facing any prejudice due to as age, occupation or nationality.

But the metaverse should not be a 'Disney Land'. It should be a different world where people are granted genuine ownership and the freedom to express their ideas without inhibition.

That being said, the metaverse will be built on a blockchain protocol which no central authority can control - and that's exactly what we strive for.

Klaytn is built to be the fundamental trust layer for the metaverse that respects the participation and contributions of all communities, bringing them together in the new world for empowerment.
