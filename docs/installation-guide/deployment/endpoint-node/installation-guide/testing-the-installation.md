# Testing the Installation <a id="testing-the-installation"></a>

It is time to check that Endpoint Node is successfully installed and it is working as expected after installation.

## Process Status <a id="process-status"></a>

It is possible to check the status of EN's process using the status commands `systemctl` and `kend`.

### systemctl <a id="systemctl"></a>

`systemctl` is installed along with the RPM, and the status of EN can be checked as follows.

```bash
$ systemctl status kend.service
‚óè kend.service - (null)
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/rc.d/init.d/kend; bad; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2019-01-09 11:42:39 UTC; 1 months 4 days ago
     Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)
  Process: 29636 ExecStart=/etc/rc.d/init.d/kend start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
 Main PID: 29641 (ken)
   CGroup: /system.slice/kend.service
           ‚îî‚îÄ29641 /usr/local/bin/ken --networkid 1000 --datadir /kend_home --port 32323 --srvtype fasthttp --metrics --prometheus --verbosity 3 --txpool.global...

Jan 09 11:42:39 ip-10-11-2-101.ap-northeast-2.compute.internal systemd[1]: Starting (null)...
Jan 09 11:42:39 ip-10-11-2-101.ap-northeast-2.compute.internal kend[29636]: Starting kend: [  OK  ]
Jan 09 11:42:39 ip-10-11-2-101.ap-northeast-2.compute.internal systemd[1]: Started (null).
```

You can check the current status such as `Active: active (running)` in the example above.

### kend <a id="kend"></a>

`kend` is installed along with the package, and the status of EN can be checked as follows.

```bash
$ kend status
kend is running
```

## Logs <a id="logs"></a>

The log is stored in `kend.out` file located in the path defined in the `LOG_DIR` field of the `kend.conf` file. When the node works properly, you can see that each block is imported per second as follows.

Example:

```bash
$ tail kend.out

## Queries <a id="queries"></a>

### ken console <a id="ken-console"></a>

Klaytn provides a CLI client: `ken console`. Another way of using the client is to connect to the process via IPC (inter-process communication). The IPC file `klay.ipc` is located in the `data` directory on an EN.

Please execute the following command and check out the result.

```text
$ ken attach /var/kend/data/klay.ipc
Welcome to the Klaytn JavaScript console!

instance: Klaytn/vX.X.X/XXXX-XXXX/goX.X.X
 datadir: /var/kend/data
 modules: admin:1.0 debug:1.0 governance:1.0 istanbul:1.0 klay:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0
 >
```

You can check the usable commands on [API Document](../../../dapp/json-rpc/README.md)

The useful APIs to check the status of EN:

* `klay.blockNumber` (to get the latest block number)
* `net.peerCount` (to get the number of the connected Klaytn nodes currently)

### klay.blockNumber <a id="klay-blocknumber"></a>

You can get the latest block number to see if blocks are propagated properly.

```text
> klay.blockNumber
11573819
```

### net.peerCount <a id="net-peercount"></a>

```text
> net.peerCount
14
```

The above command line returns the number of nodes that the EN connects to.
