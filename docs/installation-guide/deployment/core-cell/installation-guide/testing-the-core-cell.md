# Testing the Core Cell <a id="testing-the-core-cell"></a>

It is time to check that Core Cell is successfully installed and it is working as expected after installation.

## Process Status <a id="process-status"></a>

It is possible to check the status of CN/PN's process using the status commands `systemctl` and `kcnd/kpnd`.

### systemctl <a id="systemctl"></a>

`systemctl` is installed along with the RPM and the status of CN/PN can be checked as follows.

```bash
$ systemctl status kcnd.service
‚óè kcnd.service - (null)
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/rc.d/init.d/kcnd; bad; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2019-01-09 11:42:39 UTC; 1 months 4 days ago
     Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)
  Process: 29636 ExecStart=/etc/rc.d/init.d/kcnd start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
 Main PID: 29641 (kcn)
   CGroup: /system.slice/kcnd.service
           ‚îî‚îÄ29641 /usr/local/bin/kcn --networkid 1000 --datadir /kcnd_home --port 32323 --srvtype fasthttp --metrics --prometheus --verbosity 3 --txpool.global...

Jan 09 11:42:39 ip-10-11-2-101.ap-northeast-2.compute.internal systemd[1]: Starting (null)...
Jan 09 11:42:39 ip-10-11-2-101.ap-northeast-2.compute.internal kcnd[29636]: Starting kcnd: [  OK  ]
Jan 09 11:42:39 ip-10-11-2-101.ap-northeast-2.compute.internal systemd[1]: Started (null).
```

You can check the current status such as `Active: active (running)` in the above example.

### kcnd (kpnd) <a id="kcnd-kpnd"></a>

`kcnd` (or `kpnd`) is installed along with the package and the status of CN/PN can be checked as follows.

```bash
$ kcnd status
kcnd is running
```

## Logs <a id="logs"></a>

The log is stored in `kcnd.out` (or `kpnd.out`) file located in the path defined in the `LOG_DIR` field of the `kcnd.conf` (or `kpnd.conf`) file. When the node works properly, you can see that each block is created per second as follows.

Example:

```bash
$ tail kcnd.out

## kcn console (kpn console) <a id="kcn-console-kpn-console"></a>

Klaytn provides a CLI client: `kcn console` (or `kpn console`). However, a CN/PN may disable the RPC interface for the client due to the security reason. Another way of using the client is to connect to the process via IPC (inter-process communication).

The IPC file `klay.ipc` is located in the `data` directory on a CN/PN.

Please execute the following command and check out the result.

In case of a CN,

```bash
$ ken attach /var/kend/data/klay.ipc
Welcome to the Klaytn JavaScript console!

instance: Klaytn/vX.X.X/XXXX-XXXX/goX.X.X
 datadir: /var/kend/data
 modules: admin:1.0 debug:1.0 governance:1.0 istanbul:1.0 klay:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0
 >
```

In case of a PN,

```bash
 $ kpn attach /var/kpnd/data/klay.ipc
 Welcome to the Klaytn JavaScript console!

 instance: Klaytn/vX.X.X/XXXX-XXXX/goX.X.X
 coinbase: 0x67f68fdd9740fd7a1ac366294f05a3fd8df0ed40
 at block: 11573551 (Wed, 13 Feb 2019 07:12:52 UTC)
  datadir: /var/kpnd/data
  modules: admin:1.0 debug:1.0 istanbul:1.0 klay:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0
  >
```

You can check the usable commands on [API Document](../../../dapp/json-rpc/README.md)

The useful APIs to check the status of a CN/PN:

* `klay.blockNumber` (to get the latest block number)
* `net.peerCount` (to get the number of the connected Klaytn nodes currently)

### klay.blockNumber  <a id="klay-blocknumber"></a>

You can get the latest block number to see if blocks are created (for CNs) or propagated (for CNs and PNs) properly based on your node type.

```javascript
> klay.blockNumber
11573819
```

### net.peerCount  <a id="net-peercount"></a>

```javascript
> net.peerCount
14
```

The above command line returns a different value based on the node type.

* CN: the number of connected CNs + the number of connected PNs.
* PN: the number of connected CNs + the number of connected PNs + the number of connected ENs.
