# Checking Node Status <a id="checking-node-status"></a>

## Process Status <a id="process-status"></a>

It is possible to check the status of SCN's process using the status commands `systemctl` and `kscnd`.

### systemctl <a id="systemctl"></a>

`systemctl` is installed along with the RPM, and the status of SCN can be checked as follows.

```bash
$ systemctl status kscnd.service
● kscnd.service - (null)
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/rc.d/init.d/kscnd; bad; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2019-01-09 11:42:39 UTC; 1 months 4 days ago
     Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)
  Process: 29636 ExecStart=/etc/rc.d/init.d/kscnd start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
 Main PID: 29641 (kscn)
   CGroup: /system.slice/kscnd.service
           └─29641 /usr/local/bin/kscn --networkid 1000 --datadir ~/kscnd_home --port 32323 --srvtype fasthttp --metrics --prometheus --verbosity 3 --txpool.global...

Jan 09 11:42:39 ip-10-11-2-101.ap-northeast-2.compute.internal systemd[1]: Starting (null)...
Jan 09 11:42:39 ip-10-11-2-101.ap-northeast-2.compute.internal kscnd[29636]: Starting kscnd: [  OK  ]
Jan 09 11:42:39 ip-10-11-2-101.ap-northeast-2.compute.internal systemd[1]: Started (null).
```

You can check the current status such as `Active: active (running)` in the example above.

### kscnd <a id="kscnd"></a>

`kscnd` is installed along with the package, and the status of SCN can be checked as follows.

```bash
$ kscnd status
kscnd is running
```

## Logs <a id="logs"></a>

The log is stored in `kscnd.out` file located in the path defined in the `LOG_DIR` field of the `kscnd.conf` file. When the node works properly, you can see that each block is imported per second as follows.

Example:

```bash
$ tail -F ~/kscnd_home/logs/kscnd.out

## Queries <a id="queries"></a>

### kscn console <a id="kscn-console"></a>

Klaytn provides a CLI client: `kscn console`. Another way of using the client is to connect to the process via IPC (inter-process communication). The IPC file `klay.ipc` is located in the `data` directory on an SCN.

Please execute the following command and check out the result.

```text
$ kscn attach ~/kscnd_home/klay.ipc
Welcome to the Klaytn JavaScript console!

instance: Klaytn/vX.X.X/XXXX-XXXX/goX.X.X
at block: 11573551 (Wed, 13 Feb 2019 07:12:52 UTC)
 datadir: ~/kscnd_home
 modules: admin:1.0 debug:1.0 istanbul:1.0 klay:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0
 >
```

You can check the usable commands on [API Document](../../../../../dapp/json-rpc/README.md)

The useful APIs to check the status of SCN:

* `klay.blockNumber` (to get the latest block number)
* `net.peerCount` (to get the number of the connected Klaytn nodes currently)

### klay.blockNumber <a id="klay-blocknumber"></a>

You can get the latest block number to see if blocks are propagated properly.

```text
> klay.blockNumber
11573819
```

### net.peerCount <a id="net-peercount"></a>

```text
> net.peerCount
4
```

The above command line returns the number of nodes that the SCN connects to except the EN in the main chain.
