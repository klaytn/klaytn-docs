# Installation Guide

You can download the latest version of the `kcn` on [Download](../download.md) page.

## Linux Archive Distribution

The archive file consists of the executable binary and the configuration file structured as follows.

**Note**: Do NOT alter the file structure or file name. If you change it, the node may not function correctly.

```text
- bin
  |- kcn
  |- kcnd
- conf
  |- kcnd.conf
```

| File Name | File Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| bin/kcn | CN executable file |
| bin/kcnd | CN start/termination script file |
| conf/kcnd.conf | CN configuration file |

### Installation

The installation is the uncompression of the downloaded package where you want to install the package.

```bash
$ tar zxf kcn-vX.X.X-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Or,

```bash
$ tar zxf kcn-baobab-vX.X.X-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

**Note**: it is recommended that the uncompressed directory `kcn-linux-amd64/bin` path should be added to the environment variable `$PATH` to run the `kcn` and `kcnd` globally. As an example,

```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/downloaded/path/kcn-linux-amd64/bin
```

The other sections assume that the path is added to the variable.
