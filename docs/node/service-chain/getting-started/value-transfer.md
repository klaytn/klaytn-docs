This section will explain how to enable ERC-20 value transfer between Baobab network and your ServiceChain with the provided test code.
You will add KLAY to the operator account and deploy bridge and ERC-20 contracts.
Then you will register the contract address on SCN. And you will test an ERC-20 value transferring.


## Prerequisites <a id="prerequisites"></a>
- We assume that you installed the ServiceChain, and connected the ServiceChain to the Baobab EN by the instructions in [Connecting to Baobab](en-scn-connection.md).
- Clone the repository [servicechain-value-transfer-examples](https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples).
- Install `Node.js` (v14) and `npm` ([How to install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/))
    - This example leverages two packages, axios and caver-js, which both support v14.


## ERC-20 Token Transfer (one-step) <a id="erc-20-token-transfer-onestep"></a>

### Step 1: Add KLAY to the operator accounts. <a id="step-1-add-klay-to-the-operator-accounts"></a>
Connect to the SCN and check the account addresses by executing `subbridge.parentOperator` and `subbridge.childOperator`.
```
$ kscn attach --datadir ~/data
> subbridge.childOperator
"0x10221f7f9355017cd0c11444e7eecb99621bacce"
> subbridge.parentOperator
"0x3ce216beeafc62d20547376396e89528e1d778ca"
```

Create a test account on a [Baobab Wallet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.com/) and get test KLAY from the faucet. Then send 1 KLAY to the `parentOperator`. `childOperator` has to get KLAY from the test account generated by `homi` ([Refer to EN Setup and SCN Connection Guide](en-scn-connection.md)).

```
$ kscn account import ~/homi-output/keys_test/testkey1

$ kscn attach --datadir ~/data
> personal.unlockAccount("80119c31cdae67c42c8296929bb4f89b2a52cec4")
Unlock account 80119c31cdae67c42c8296929bb4f89b2a52cec4
Passphrase:
True
> klay.sendTransaction({from:"80119c31cdae67c42c8296929bb4f89b2a52cec4", to:subbridge.childOperator, value: web3.toPeb(1000, "KLAY")})
"0x84caab84ebf0c4bb4ecf0a7849f1de3e479f1863a95f70c51047a7ca7bc64b33"
```
Check if the operator accounts have enough balance.
```
> klay.getBalance(subbridge.childOperator)
1e+21
> klay.getBalance(subbridge.parentOperator)
1e+18
```

### Step 2: Deploy Contracts <a id="step-2-deploy-contracts"></a>
- Connect to the SCN and prepare the node environment for contract deployment.
Clone the repository [servicechain-value-transfer-examples](https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples).

In this step, we would deploy both the bridge contract and token contract in the parent as well as the child chain.
Token contracts are for mint/transfer test and bridge contracts are used to listen/handle value transfer requests.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples
$ cd servicechain-value-transfer-examples
$ npm install
$ cd erc20
```

On a text editor, edit the `bridge_info.json` as below.
- Replace `url` in the `child` section (SCN node on ServiceChain network) with your SCN node IP and the proper port number from `RPC_PORT` in `kscnd.conf`.
- Replace `child.key` with `testkey1` that was generated by `homi`.
- Set `child.operator` to the `subbridge.childOperator` address that we examined in the previous step.
- Replace `url` in the `parent` section (EN node on Baobab network) with your EN node IP and the proper port number from `RPC_PORT` in `kend.conf`.
- Replace `parent.key` with the private key of the test account created from [Baobab Wallet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.com/) in the previous step.
- Set `parent.operator` as the `subbridge.parentOperator` of the previous step.

```
{
     "child" : {
         "url": "http://192.168.0.1:7551",
         "key": "0x66cb283353589a10866b58d388e9d956e5a9c873a8c78fa4411d460c19c494ea",
         "operator": "0x10221f7f9355017cd0c11444e7eecb99621bacce"
     },
     "parent" : {
         "url": "http://192.168.0.5:8551",
         "key": "0x26f4b5ac42ceabcfd3b23a991fdbfc792d10ce700a99582fdf9185a8f163b790",
         "operator": "0x3ce216beeafc62d20547376396e89528e1d778ca"
     }
 }
```

- Add `subbridge` to `RPC_API` of `kscnd.conf`. This setting is required for sending an RPC call from the deployment script.
```
RPC_API="klay,subbridge"
```

Perform the token deployment by running the command `node erc20-deploy.js`. This script deploys both the bridge contract and the token contract, and it sends RPC calls to register and subscribe the token contract to the bridge contract.
```
$ node erc20-deploy.js
------------------------- erc20-deploy START -------------------------
info.bridge: 0xcb9e197cc328c39376C5aB7Dc5d3C684D5F9d2f3
info.token: 0xd88d18D05629d58432FB192adE5c56279a2E5a2B
info.bridge: 0x1Da965D374Dc8065781394B01F669a190fB981C2
info.token: 0x09Ced338326DF53cea7e595C803c662eC020a0A5
registering bridges to the child node
subscribing bridges to the child node
register token to subbridge..
------------------------- erc20-deploy END -------------------------
```

You can see the required initialization APIs in the deployment source code. If you want to register them manually, you can type the API calls in your attached console.
NOTE: DO NOT run these commands if you ran `node erc20-deploy.js` since the script already called those APIs (It causes a duplicate error).
```
> subbridge.registerBridge("0xCHILD_BRIDGE_ADDR", "0xPARENT_BRIDGE_ADDR")
null
> subbridge.subscribeBridge("0xCHILD_BRIDGE_ADDR", "0xPARENT_BRIDGE_ADDR")
null
> subbridge.registerToken("0xCHILD_BRIDGE_ADDR", "0xPARENT_BRIDGE_ADDR", "0xCHILD_TOKEN_ADDR", "0XPARENT_TOKEN_ADDR")
null
```

### Step 3: Token transfer <a id="step-3-token-transfer"></a>
Perform token transfer with the command `node erc20-transfer-1step.js`. This one-step token transfer requires modification of an ERC-20 token implementation. If you don't want to modify the token contract or you have a token contract that is already deployed, please refer to [ERC-20 Token Transfer (two-step)](#erc-20-token-transfer-twostep).
```
$ node erc20-transfer-1step.js
------------------------- erc20-transfer-1step START -------------------------
alice balance: 0
requestValueTransfer..
alice balance: 100
------------------------- erc20-transfer-1step END -------------------------
```

If the result is `alice balance: 100`, then it has been executed successfully.

## ERC-20 Token Transfer (two-step) <a id="erc-20-token-transfer-twostep"></a>
Run erc20-transfer-2step.js for the two-step transfer example. With this two-step token transfer example, unmodified ERC-20 token contracts can be used.
The two-step transfer consists of two function calls: (1) approve the bridge contract first, and then (2) call the contract function `requestERC20Transfer()`.
We do not deploy contracts in this section since we already deployed both bridge and token contracts. You must deploy first if you didn't deploy them. You can deploy the contract using `node erc20-deploy.js`.
```
$ node erc20-transfer-2step.js
> ------------------------- erc20-transfer-2step START -------------------------
> alice balance: 100
> requestValueTransfer..
> alice balance: 200
------------------------- erc20-transfer-2step END -------------------------
```

## KIP-7 Token Transfer via ERC-20 Interface (two-step) <a id="kip-7-token-transfer-via-erc-20-interface-two-step"></a>
[KIP-7](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-7) is a token standard compatible with ERC-20. We can call `requestERC20Transfer()` function to a KIP-7 token contract to transfer KIP-7 tokens between a parent chain and a child chain.
In the case of sending KIP-7 tokens via the ERC-20 interface, we call the `approve()` function to allow the bridge to send the tokens on behalf of the transaction sender. Then call the `requestERC20Transfer()` function.
The below command deploys the bridge contract and a KIP-7 contract. Then it registers and subscribes the bridge contract.
```
$ node kip7-deploy.js
> ------------------------- kip7-deploy START -------------------------
> info.bridge: 0x1362aBc251a8FC14C40Cb59Cb112B0FC74Baa9B4
> info.token: 0x30F194D1f25BC9b6773e59e9214b018dCc99add5
> info.bridge: 0x49523a060E172d3591867A6c3d15c9DA770fAF7E
> info.token: 0x73B8BF60573B2D0093312fdB79Ed6Cb1c05C62Bc
> registering bridges to the child node
> subscribing bridges to the child node
> register token to subbridge..
------------------------- kip7-deploy END -------------------------
```
The below command is an example of sending KIP-7 tokens using the ERC-20 interface with `requestERC20Transfer()`.

```
$ node kip7-transfer-2step-erc20-interface.js
> ------------------------- kip7-transfer-2step-erc20-interface START -------------------------
> alice balance: 0
> requestValueTransfer..
> alice balance: 100
> ------------------------- kip7-transfer-2step-erc20-interface END -------------------------
```

## Native Support for KIP-7 and KIP-17 (To Be Implemented) <a id="native-support-for-kip-7-and-kip-17-to-be-implemented"></a>
Currently, the bridge contract provided by the Klaytn team supports only `requestERC20Transfer()` and `requestERC721Transfer()` for token transfer. The corresponding request functions for KIP-7 and KIP-17 will be supported soon. Before the implementation is done, as you can see above, you can transfer KIP-7 tokens using ERC-20 interfaces.

## Value Transfer for ERC-721, KIP-17, and KLAY <a id="value-transfer-for-erc721-kip17-and-klay"></a>
The workflow for ERC-721, KIP-17, and KLAY is the same as above. [`erc721`](https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples/tree/master/erc721), [`kip17`](https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples/tree/master/kip17), and [`klay`](https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples/tree/master/klay) directories contain corresponding example source code.
