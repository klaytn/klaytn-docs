This section will explain how to enable ERC-20 value transfer between Baobab network and your ServiceChain with the provided test code.
You will add KLAY to the operator account and deploy bridge and ERC-20 contracts.
Then you will register the contract address on SCN. And you will test an ERC-20 value transferring.


## Prerequisites <a id="prerequisites"></a>
- We assume that you installed the ServiceChain, and connected the ServiceChain to the Baobab EN by the instructions in [Connecting to Baobab](en-scn-connection.md).
- Clone the repository [servicechain-value-transfer-examples](https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples).
- Install `Node.js` (v14) and `npm` ([How to install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/))
    - This example leverages two packages, axios and caver-js, which both support v14.


## ERC-20 Token Transfer (one-step) <a id="erc-20-token-transfer-onestep"></a>

### Step 1: Add KLAY to the operator accounts. <a id="step-1-add-klay-to-the-operator-accounts"></a>
Connect to the SCN and check the account addresses by executing `subbridge.parentOperator` and `subbridge.childOperator`.
```
$ kscn attach --datadir ~/data
> subbridge.childOperator
"0x10221f7f9355017cd0c11444e7eecb99621bacce"
> subbridge.parentOperator
"0x3ce216beeafc62d20547376396e89528e1d778ca"
```

Create a test account on a [Baobab Wallet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.com/) and get test KLAY from the faucet. Then send 1 KLAY to the `parentOperator`. `childOperator` has to get KLAY from the test account generated by `homi` ([Refer to EN Setup and SCN Connection Guide](en-scn-connection.md)).

```
$ kscn account import ~/homi-output/keys_test/testkey1

Passphrase:
True
> klay.sendTransaction({from:"80119c31cdae67c42c8296929bb4f89b2a52cec4", to:subbridge.childOperator, value: web3.toPeb(1000, "KLAY")})
"0x84caab84ebf0c4bb4ecf0a7849f1de3e479f1863a95f70c51047a7ca7bc64b33"
```
Check if the operator accounts have enough balance.
```
> klay.getBalance(subbridge.childOperator)
1e+21
> klay.getBalance(subbridge.parentOperator)
1e+18
```

### Step 2: Deploy Contracts <a id="step-2-deploy-contracts"></a>
- Connect to the SCN and prepare the node environment for contract deployment.
Clone the repository [servicechain-value-transfer-examples](https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples).

In this step, we would deploy both the bridge contract and token contract in the parent as well as the child chain.
Token contracts are for mint/transfer test and bridge contracts are used to listen/handle value transfer requests.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples
$ cd servicechain-value-transfer-examples
$ npm install
$ cd erc20
```

On a text editor, edit the `bridge_info.json` as below.
- Replace `url` in the `child` section (SCN node on ServiceChain network) with your SCN node IP and the proper port number from `RPC_PORT` in `kscnd.conf`.
- Replace `child.key` with `testkey1` that was generated by `homi`.
- Set `child.operator` to the `subbridge.childOperator` address that we examined in the previous step.
- Replace `url` in the `parent` section (EN node on Baobab network) with your EN node IP and the proper port number from `RPC_PORT` in `kend.conf`.
- Replace `parent.key` with the private key of the test account created from [Baobab Wallet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.com/) in the previous step.
- Set `parent.operator` as the `subbridge.parentOperator` of the previous step.

```
{
     "child" : {
         "url": "http://192.168.0.1:7551",
         "key": "0x66cb283353589a10866b58d388e9d956e5a9c873a8c78fa4411d460c19c494ea",
         "operator": "0x10221f7f9355017cd0c11444e7eecb99621bacce"
     },
     "parent" : {
         "url": "http://192.168.0.5:8551",
         "key": "0x26f4b5ac42ceabcfd3b23a991fdbfc792d10ce700a99582fdf9185a8f163b790",
         "operator": "0x3ce216beeafc62d20547376396e89528e1d778ca"
     }
 }
```

- Add `subbridge` to `RPC_API` of `kscnd.conf`. This setting is required for sending an RPC call from the deployment script.
```
RPC_API="klay,subbridge"
```

Perform the token deployment by running the command `node erc20-deploy.js`. This script deploys both the bridge contract and the token contract, and it sends RPC calls to register and subscribe the token contract to the bridge contract.
```
$ node erc20-deploy.js
------------------------- erc20-deploy START -------------------------
info.bridge: 0xcb9e197cc328c39376C5aB7Dc5d3C684D5F9d2f3
info.token: 0xd88d18D05629d58432FB192adE5c56279a2E5a2B
info.bridge: 0x1Da965D374Dc8065781394B01F669a190fB981C2
info.token: 0x09Ced338326DF53cea7e595C803c662eC020a0A5
registering bridges to the child node
subscribing bridges to the child node
register token to subbridge..
------------------------- erc20-deploy END -------------------------
```

You can see the required initialization APIs in the deployment source code. If you want to register them manually, you can type the API calls in your attached console.
Do not run these commands if you ran `node erc20-deploy.js` since the script already called those APIs (It causes a duplicate error).
```
> subbridge.registerBridge("0xCHILD_BRIDGE_ADDR", "0xPARENT_BRIDGE_ADDR")
null
> subbridge.subscribeBridge("0xCHILD_BRIDGE_ADDR", "0xPARENT_BRIDGE_ADDR")
null
> subbridge.registerToken("0xCHILD_BRIDGE_ADDR", "0xPARENT_BRIDGE_ADDR", "0xCHILD_TOKEN_ADDR", "0XPARENT_TOKEN_ADDR")
null
```

### Step 3: Token transfer <a id="step-3-token-transfer"></a>
Perform token transfer with the command `node erc20-transfer-1step.js`. This one-step token transfer requires modification of an ERC-20 token implementation. If you don't want to modify the token contract or you have a token contract that is already deployed, please refer to [ERC-20 Token Transfer (two-step)](#erc-20-token-transfer-twostep).
```
$ node erc20-transfer-1step.js
------------------------- erc20-transfer-1step START -------------------------
alice balance: 0
requestValueTransfer..
alice balance: 100
------------------------- erc20-transfer-1step END -------------------------
```

If the result is `alice balance: 100`, then it has been executed successfully.

## ERC-20 Token Transfer (two-step) <a id="erc-20-token-transfer-twostep"></a>
Run erc20-transfer-2step.js for the two-step transfer example.
The two-step transfer consists of two function calls: (1) approve the bridge contract first, and then (2) call the contract function `requestERC20Transfer()`.
We do not deploy contracts since we already deployed both bridge and token contracts. You must deploy first if you didn't deploy them. You can deploy the contract using `node erc20-deploy.js`.
```
$ node erc20-transfer-2step.js
> ------------------------- erc20-transfer-2step START -------------------------
> alice balance: 100
> requestValueTransfer..
> alice balance: 200
------------------------- erc20-transfer-2step END -------------------------
```

## KIP-7 Token Transfer via ERC-20 Interface (two-step) <a id="kip-7-token-transfer-via-erc-20-interface-two-step"></a>
KIP-7 is a compatible token standard with ERC20. We can call `requestERC20Transfer()` function to a KIP-7 token contract to transfer KIP-7 Tokens between a parent chain and a child chain.
In the case of sending KIP-7 tokens via ERC-20 interface, we call the `approve()` function to allow the bridge to send the tokens on behalf of the transaction sender. Then call the `requestERC20Transfer()` function.
The below command deploys the bridge contract and a KIP-7 contract. Then it registers and subscribes the bridge contract.
```
$ node kip7-deploy.js
> ------------------------- kip7-deploy START -------------------------
> info.bridge: 0x1362aBc251a8FC14C40Cb59Cb112B0FC74Baa9B4
> info.token: 0x30F194D1f25BC9b6773e59e9214b018dCc99add5
> info.bridge: 0x49523a060E172d3591867A6c3d15c9DA770fAF7E
> info.token: 0x73B8BF60573B2D0093312fdB79Ed6Cb1c05C62Bc
> registering bridges to the child node
> subscribing bridges to the child node
> register token to subbridge..
------------------------- kip7-deploy END -------------------------
```
The below command is an example of sending KIP-7 tokens using the ERC-20 interface with `requestERC20Transfer()`.

```
$ node kip7-transfer-2step-erc20-interface.js
> ------------------------- kip7-transfer-2step-erc20-interface START -------------------------
> alice balance: 0
> requestValueTransfer..
> alice balance: 100
> ------------------------- kip7-transfer-2step-erc20-interface END -------------------------
```

## Native Support for KIP-7 and KIP-17 (To Be Implemented) <a id="native-support-for-kip-7-and-kip-17-to-be-implemented"></a>
Currently, the bridge contract provided by the Klaytn team supports only `requestERC20Transfer()` and `requestERC721Transfer()` for token transfer. The corresponding request functions for KIP-7 and KIP-17 will be supported soon. Before the implementation is done, as you can see above, you can transfer KIP-7 tokens using ERC-20 interfaces.

## Value Transfer for ERC-721, KIP-17, and KLAY <a id="value-transfer-for-erc721-kip17-and-klay"></a>
The workflow is the same as above. [`erc721`](https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples/tree/master/erc721), [`kip17`](https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples/tree/master/kip17), and [`klay`](https://github.com/klaytn/servicechain-value-transfer-examples/tree/master/klay) directories contain corresponding example source code.
