# Installation Guide

You can download the latest version of the `ken` on [Download](download.md) page.

## Linux Archive Distribution

The archive file consists of the executable binary and the configuration file structured as follows.

**Note**: Do NOT alter the file structure or file name. If you change it, the node may not function correctly.

```text
- bin
  |- ken
  |- kend
- conf
  |- kend.conf
```

| File Name | File Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| bin/ken | EN executable file |
| bin/kend | EN start/termination script file |
| conf/kend.conf | EN configuration file |

### Installation

The installation is the uncompression of the downloaded package where you want to install the package.

```text
$ tar zxf ken-vX.X.X-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Or,

```text
$ tar zxf ken-baobab-vX.X.X-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

**Note**: it is recommended that the uncompressed directory `ken-linux-amd64/bin` path should be added to the environment variable `$PATH` to run the `ken` and `kend` globally. As an example,

```text
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/downloaded/path/ken-linux-amd64/bin
```

The other sections assume that the path is added to the variable.
