## Attaching to the Console <a id="attaching-to-the-console"></a>

Klaytn Endpoint Node comes with JavaScript console. From the console command line, you can initiate part of Klaytn API calls to your EN. To attach to the JavaScript console, execute the following command.

```bash
$ ken attach ~/kend_home/klay.ipc
Welcome to the Klaytn JavaScript console

!​instance: Klaytn/vX.X.X/XXXX-XXXX/goX.X.X
 datadir: ~/kend_home
 modules: admin:1.0 debug:1.0 governance:1.0 istanbul:1.0 klay:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0

 ​>
```

**NOTE**: You must wait until it downloads all the blocks. Enter `klay.blockNumber` in a console and check whether it matches the current block number [here](https://baobab.scope.klaytn.com/)

**NOTE**: Type `klay` or `personal` to get the list of available functions.

## Creating a New Klaytn Account <a id="creating-a-new-klaytn-account"></a>

To create a new Klaytn account from the JavaScript console, execute the following command. Your private key will be encrypted with the passphrase you enter.

```javascript
> personal.newAccount()
Passphrase:  # enter your passphrase
Repeat passphrase:
"0x75a59b94889a05c03c66c3c84e9d2f8308ca4abd" # created account address
```

Keystore file will be created under `keystore` folder in the EN data directory, `DATA_DIR` set in the `kend.conf`. If you follows the quick start default guideline, it must be `~/kend_home/keystore/`.

```javascript
$ ls ~/kend_home/keystore/
UTC--2019-06-24T11-20-15.590879000Z--75a59b94889a05c03c66c3c84e9d2f8308ca4abd
