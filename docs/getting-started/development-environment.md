# Development Environment

**Klaytn Networks**

* Baobab testnet
* Cypress mainnet

**Endpoint Node**

* [Endpoint Node](../node/endpoint-node/) is needed to connect to the Klaytn network and to issue an API call or send a transaction. 
* `ken` is a Klaytn Endpoint Node binary. `ken` exposes two interfaces, a [command-line interface](../node/endpoint-node/ken-cli-commands.md) and the [JSON-RPC APIs](../bapp/json-rpc/). `ken` runs on Linux and MacOS.
* `ken` CLI comes with several utility and node management functions.

**Smart Contract Development**

* [Klaytn IDE](https://ide.klaytn.com/) - A browser-based compiler and IDE for the Klaytn smart contracts. 
* [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) - An open-source tool for developing smart contracts in Solidity.

**Klaytn SDKs**

* [caver-js](../bapp/sdk/caver-js/) : A JavaScript library that implements the Klaytn JSON-RPC APIs.
* [caver-java](../bapp/sdk/caver-java/) : A Java library that implements the Klaytn JSON-RPC APIs. 

**Klaytn Toolkits**

* [Klaytnscope](https://scope.klaytn.com/) - A block and transaction explorer.
