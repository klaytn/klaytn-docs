# Genesis File

This page describes the details of `genesis.json` file.

## Genesis JSON File Structure <a id="genesis-json-file-structure"></a>

The `genesis.json` file structure is described in the following table.

|             Field Name         |         Description           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| config                         | The blokchain configuration. See the section [Config](#config). |

| extraData                      | The data combined field for signer vanity and RLP-encoded istanbul extra data that contains validator list, proposer seal, and commit seals. |
| gasLimit                       | The maximum gas amount that used in a block. |
| difficulty                     | (deprecated) This field is derived from the Ethereum, but not used in Klaytn. |
| mixhash                        | (deprecated) This field is derived from the Ethereum, but not used in Klaytn. |
| coinbase                       | An address to which miner receives the reward. This field is only used for Clique consensus engine. |
| alloc                          | The predefined accounts. |
| number                         | The block number field. |
| gasUsed                        | The amount of the gas which used for a block. |
| parentHash                     | The hash value of the previous block. |

### Config <a id="config"></a>

The `config` field stores the information related to the chain.

|           Field Name           |         Description           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| chainId                        | It identifies the current chain and is used for prevention from the replay attack. |
| istanbulCompatibleBlock        | A block number to which istanbul change is applied. |
| istanbul, clique               | The type of consensus engine. |
| unitPrice                      | Unit price. |
| deriveShaImpl                  | Defines a method to generate transaction hash and receipt hash. |
| governance                     | Governance information of the network. See the section [Governance](#governance) |


### extraData <a id="extradata"></a>

The field `extraData` is a concatenation of the proposer vanity and the RLP-encoded istanbul extra data:

  - The proposer vanity is 32-byte data which contains arbitrary proposer vanity data.
  - The rest of the data is RLP-encoded istanbul extra data containing:
     - Validators: the list of validators in ascending order.
     - Seal: the proposer signature of the header. For `genesis.json`, it is a byte array initialized with 65 `0x0`.
     - CommittedSeal: the list of commitment signature seals as consensus proof. For `genesis.json`, it is an empty array.

**Example**
| Field | Type | Value |
| ----- | ---- | ----- |
| Vanity | 32-byte hex string | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |
| Validators | []address | [0x48009b4e20ec72aadf306577cbe2eaf54b0ebb16,0x089fcc42fd83baeee4831319375413b8bae3aceb] |
| Seal | byte array of 65 elements | [0x0,...,0x0] |
| CommittedSeal | [][]byte  | [] |

`extraData` with the above data is created by
```
concat('0x',Vanity,RLPEncode({Validators,Seal,CommittedSeal}))
```
where `concat` is a string concatenation function, and `RLPEncode` is a function to convert a given structure to an RLP-encoded string.

With this function, the output `extraData` for this example is 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f86fea9448009b4e20ec72aadf306577cbe2eaf54b0ebb1694089fcc42fd83baeee4831319375413b8bae3acebb8410000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c0.
