- The issue is not a duplicate issue.
- The issue has not been covered in the latest release of Klaytn Docs.
- The issue covers minor typos or errors on the existing content of Klaytn Docs.
Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Use developers@klaytn.foundation for the personal support requests.

After confirming your report meets the above criteria, [submit the issue](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn-docs/issues). Please use [labels](#usage-of-labels) to specify your issue as `issues-and-typos`.

- The issue is not a duplicate issue.
- The issue has not been covered in the latest release of Klaytn Docs.
- The issue covers major content change (e.g. Adding/removing paragraph and chapter in Klaytn Docs, adding/removing graphical explanation, etc.) on the existing content of Klaytn Docs.
Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Use developers@klaytn.foundation for the personal support requests.

After confirming your report meets the above criteria, [submit the issue](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn-docs/issues). Please use [labels](#usage-of-labels) to specify your issue as `content-contribution`.

### Content Translation

If you are fluent in a language other than English and want to contribute translations or improve the localized documentation, [submit an issue](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn-docs/issues). Please use [labels](#usage-of-labels) to specify your issue as `content-translation`.

You need to use the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/klaytn-docs) platform to contribute translations. For more information, see the [Internationalization](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/docs/misc/internationalization/) page.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For content translation, avoid using a pull request to submit changes by modifying the files under the [i18n](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn-docs/tree/main/i18n) directory directly. </br> </br> Unlike other types of contribution, the translations are managed by Crowdin localization management platform. If a translation is submitted and has been approved in Crowdin, an automated PR will be made to Klaytn docs repo. Once the PR is approved and merged by the project moderators, the localized Klaytn docs will be updated with the suggested changes (merged content).

## Usage of Labels

You can use the following labels:

Labels for initial issue categories:

- issue/issues-and-typos: Issues with the minor content typos and inaccuracy.
- issue/content-contribution: Issues with major content contributions.
- issue/content-translation: Issues with content translations.

Status of open issues (will be tagged by the project moderators):

- (no label): The default status.
- open/need more information : The issue's creator needs to provide additional information to review.
- open/reviewing: The issue is under review.
- open/re-label needed: The label needs to be changed to confirmed as being a `issues-and-typos`, future `content-contribution`, or `content-translation`.
- open/contribution welcome: The content fix or update is approved and you are invited to contribute to it.

Status of closed issues:

- closed/fixed: A fix for the issue was provided.
- closed/duplicate: The issue is also reported in a different issue and is being managed there.
- closed/invalid: The issue is not applicable to the Klaytn Docs.
- closed/reject: The issue is rejected after review.

## Additional Contribution Guidelines

Here are some additional guidelines to follow when contributing to Klaytn Docs:

### Commit Messages

- Start with a capitalized and imperative verb. Examples include "Update", "Fix", "Add", "Improve", etc.
- Use a consistent format for commit messages. A common pattern is "verb: description of change" (for example, "Update contract addresses for Kaia chain").
- Keep the subject line short and descriptive. It should clearly communicate the scope and focus of the change.

### Build and Dependencies

If your contribution involves adding new code or dependencies, ensure the project continues to build successfully after your changes by running a build command (for example, `npm run build`).

### Image Optimization

- Keep all images optimized and compressed to minimize file size (under 30kb whenever possible). This helps to improve website loading speed and keeps the repository size manageable.
- Consider using tools like [Trimage](https://trimage.org/) to optimize your images.
