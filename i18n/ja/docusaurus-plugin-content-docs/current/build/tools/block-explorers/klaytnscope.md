# Klaytnscope

Klaytnscope is the block explorer for the Klaytn Network. Klaytnscope gives you an insight about the Klaytn network by monitoring the network health and providing various statistics of Klaytn network. You can also explore the block and transaction data and the list of smart contracts on the Klaytn network.

In the subsequent sections, we will visit the major functions and screenshots of Klaytnscope. Functions are grouped by four categories - dashboard, list view, detail view, and search.

## Dashboard <a id="dashboard"></a>

Network information is presented in the dashboard. The information includes average block generation time, average number of transactions in a block, number of consensus nodes, and the latest trends in transactions.
