# Massive Eco Fund

## Our Full-suite, Protocol-level $1B+ Eco Fund <a id="our-full-suite-protocol-level-eco-fund"></a>

Klaytn is the first and the largest example in which the incentives supporting the ecosystem are encoded in an on-chain protocol tokenomics. 66% of the newly minted tokens are reinvested in the ecosystem.

Initially issued reserve tokens will also be used as a resource for investment
in the ecosystem expansion.

- [Klaytn Community Fund (KCF)](../token-economy.md#klaytn-community-fund)
- [Klaytn Foundation Fund (KFF)](../token-economy.md#klaytn-foundation-fund).
