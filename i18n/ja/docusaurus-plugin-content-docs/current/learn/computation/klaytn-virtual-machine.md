# Klaytn Virtual Machine

## Overview <a id="overview"></a>

The current version of the Klaytn Virtual Machine (KLVM) is derived from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The content of this chapter is based primarily on the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper). KLVM is continuously being improved by the Klaytn team, thus this document could be updated frequently. Please do not regard this document as the final version of the KLVM specification. As described in the Klaytn position paper, the Klaytn team also plans to adopt other virtual machines or execution environments in order to strengthen the capability and performance of the Klaytn platform. This chapter presents a specification of KLVM and the differences between KLVM and EVM.

KLVM is a virtual state machine that formally specifies Klaytn's execution model. The execution model specifies how the system state is altered given a series of bytecode instructions and a small tuple of environmental data. KLVM is a quasi-Turing-complete machine; the _quasi_ qualification stems from the fact that the computation is intrinsically bounded through a parameter, _gas_, which limits the total amount of computation performed.

KLVM executes Klaytn virtual machine code (or Klaytn bytecode) which consists of a sequence of KLVM instructions. The KLVM code is the programming language used for accounts on the Klaytn blockchain that contain code. The KLVM code associated with an account is executed every time a message is sent to that account; this code has the ability to read/write from/to storage and send messages.

## KLVM Specification <a id="klvm-specification"></a>

### Conventions <a id="conventions"></a>

We use the following notations and conventions in this document.

- `A := B`
  - `:=` is used to define `A` as `B`.
- We use the terms "smart contract" and "contract" interchangeably.
- We use the terms "opcode" as the "operation code/operation"

### Basics <a id="basics"></a>

KLVM is a simple stack-based architecture. The word size of the machine (and thus the size of stack items) is 256-bit. This was chosen to facilitate the Keccak-256 hash scheme and the elliptic-curve computations. The memory model is a simple word-addressed byte array. The stack has a maximum size of 1024. The machine also has an independent storage model; this is similar in concept to the memory but rather than a byte array, it is a word-addressable word array. Unlike memory, which is volatile, storage is nonvolatile and is maintained as part of the system state. All locations in both storage and memory are initially well-defined as zero.

The machine does not follow the standard von Neumann architecture. Rather than storing program code in generally accessible memory or storage, code is stored separately in virtual read-only memory and can be interacted with only through specialized instructions.

The machine can execute exception code for several reasons, including stack underflows and invalid instructions. Similar to an out-of-gas exception, these exceptions do not leave state changes intact. Rather, the virtual machine halts immediately and reports the issue to the execution agent (either the transaction processor or, recursively, the spawning execution environment), which will be addressed separately.

### Execution Environment <a id="execution-environment"></a>

The execution environment consists of the system state `S_system`, the remaining gas for computation `G_rem`, and the information `I` that the execution agent provides. `I` is a tuple defined as shown below:

`I := (B_header, T_code, T_depth, T_value, T_data, A_tx_sender, A_code_executor, A_code_owner, G_price, P_modify_state)`

The execution model defines the function `F_apply`, which can compute the resultant state `S_system`, the remaining gas `G_rem`, the accrued substate `A` and the resultant output `O_result` when given these definitions. For the present context, we will define it as follows:

`(S_system', G_rem', A, O_result) = F_apply(S_system, G_rem, I)`

where we must remember that `A`, the accrued substate, is defined as the tuple of the suicides set `Set_suicide`, the log series `L`, the touched accounts `Set_touched_accounts` and the refunds `G_refund`:

`A := (Set_suicide, L, Set_touched_accounts, G_refund)`

### Execution Overview <a id="execution-overview"></a>

In most practical implementations, `F_apply` will be modeled as an iterative progression of the pair comprising the full system state `S_system` and the machine state `S_machine`. Formally, we define it recursively with a function `X` that uses an iterator function `O` (which defines the result of a single cycle of the state machine) together with functions `Z`, which determines if the present state is an exceptional halted machine state, and `H`, which specifies the output data of an instruction if and only if the present state is a normal halted machine state.

The empty sequence, denoted as `()`, is not equal to the empty set, denoted as `Set_empty`; this is important when interpreting the output of `H`, which evaluates to `Set_empty` when execution is to continue but to a series (potentially empty) when execution should halt.

`F_apply(S_machine, G_rem, I, T) := (S_system', S_machine,g', A, o)`

- `(S_system', S_machine,g', A, ..., o) := X((S_system, S_machine, A^0, I))`
- `S_machine,g := G_rem`
- `S_machine,pc := 0`
- `S_machine,memory := (0, 0, ...)`
- `S_machine,i := 0`
- `S_machine,stack := ()`
- `S_machine,o := ()`
- `X((S_system, S_machine, A, I)) :=`
  - `(Set_empty, S_machine, A^0, I, Set_empty)` if `Z(S_system, S_machine, I)`
  - `(Set_empty, S_machine', A^0, I, o)` if `w = REVERT`
  - `O(S_system, S_machine, A, I) · o` if `o != Set_empty`
  - `X(O(S_system, S_machine, A, I))` otherwise

where

- `o := H(S_machine, I)`
- `(a, b, c, d) · e := (a, b, c, d, e)`
- `S_machine' := S_machine` except

  `S_machine,g' := S_machine,g - C(S_system, S_machine, I)`

  - This means that when we evaluate `F_apply`, we

    extract the remaining gas `S_machine,g'` from the

    resultant machine state `S_machine'`.

`X` is thus cycled (recursively here, but implementations are generally expected to use a simple iterative loop) until either `Z` becomes true, indicating that the present state is exceptional and that the machine must be halted and any changes are discarded, or until `H` becomes a series (rather than the empty set), indicating that the machine has reached a controlled halt.

#### Machine State <a id="machine-state"></a>

The machine state `S_machine` is defined as a tuple `(g, pc, memory, i, stack)`, which represent the available gas, the program counter `pc` (64-bit unsigned integer), the memory contents, the active number of words in memory (counting continuously from position 0), and the stack contents. The memory contents `S_machine,memory` are a series of zeroes of size 2^256.

For ease of reading, the instruction mnemonics written in small-caps (_e.g._, `ADD`) should be interpreted as their numeric equivalents; the full table of instructions and their specifics is given in the [Instruction Set](klaytn-virtual-machine#instruction-set) section.

To define `Z`, `H` and `O`, we define `w` as the current operation to be executed:

- `w := T_code[S_machine,pc]` if `S_machine,pc < len(T_code)`
- `w :=STOP` otherwise

## How KLVM Differs From EVM <a id="how-klvm-differs-from-evm"></a>

As mentioned earlier, the current KLVM is based on EVM; thus, its specification currently is very similar to that of EVM. Some differences between KLVM and EVM are listed below.

- KLVM uses Klaytn's gas units, such as peb, ston, or KLAY.
- KLVM does not accept a gas price from the user; instead, it uses a platform-defined value as the gas price.

The Klaytn team will try to maintain compatibility between KLVM and EVM, but as Klaytn becomes increasingly implemented and evolves, the KLVM specification will be updated, and there will probably be more differences compared to EVM.

NOTE: This section will be updated in the future.
