# Multi-Channel

A Klaytn node can be run with **Multi-channel**.

If a node is executed with multi-channel configuration, 2 ports are set up for communication. On the otherhand, if a node is executed with single channel configuration, 1 port is set up.
If 2 multi-channel nodes are trying to connect, a connection is established using 2 ports. Otherwise, they will use 1 port for communication.

A multi-channel node can be enabled through the flag `--multichannel`. If you use [`kend`](../nodes/endpoint-node/install-endpoint-nodes.md), multi-channel is enabled by default due to the statement `MULTICHANNEL=1` in [`kend.conf`](../nodes/endpoint-node/install-endpoint-nodes.md). To disable multi-channel, please replace the statement with `MULTICHANNEL=0`.
If you want to run a node with specific ports, flags `port` and `subport` can be used. If you want to specify ports values of a connecting peer, check out [KNI](./kni.md).

## Architecture <a id="architecture"></a>

![Multi-Channel Server](/img/learn/multichannel.png)

The picture above shows a connection between two multi-channel nodes.
Two ports, mainport (A) and subport (B), transfer different messages.

- **Mainport**(A) is used to transfer messages related to blocks and consensus protocols.
  - Block messages include requests and responses of the hash, header, body and receipt of a block.
  - Consensus messages include Request, Preprepare, Prepare, Commit and RoundChange. The meaning of the messages can be found in [PBFT](./consensus-mechanism.md#pbft-practical-byzantine-fault-tolerance).
- **Subport**(B) is for transferring transaction messages.

![Single Channel Server](/img/learn/singlechannel.png)

The picture shows a connection between two single channel nodes or between a single channel node and a multi-channel node.
In this case, all messages related to blocks, transactions, and consensus protocols are transported via the same port.

## Ports  <a id="multichannel-port"></a>

To set port numbers in KNI, please refer to [the KNI scheme](./kni.md).

- Single Channel : A single channel node uses one port (default is 32323).
- Multi-Channel: A multi-channel node uses two ports. The ports can be specified in `port` and `subport`. In Klaytn, the default values of `port` and `subport` are 32323 and 32324, respectively.
  - You might not set `subport` when connecting to multi-channel node. In this case, at first, a Klaytn node tries to connect using a single-channel. In handshake process, the actual peer's port numbers are revealed. If the peer is a multi-channel node, the ongoing connection will be canceled and a reconnection will be made with the updated ports.
