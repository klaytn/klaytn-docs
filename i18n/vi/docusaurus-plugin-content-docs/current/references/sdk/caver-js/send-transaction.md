# Sending a sample transaction

Let's try sending a transaction as a simple warm-up. In this short example, we will be creating a keystore, connecting to Klaytn node, as well as creating a transaction - all of this using caver-js!

Don't worry if this is your first time using caver-js. Just follow the simple steps below.

## Prerequisites

First install the following packages.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version ([14.16.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/))
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Solidity compiler](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installing-solidity.html)

_Note:_ If you get an `nvm: command not found` error after installing nvm, refer to this [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/2060).

## 1. Create an Account and Download Keystore <a id="1.-create-an-account-and-download-keystore"></a>

The most simple way to create an account is using the [Klaytn Online Toolkit](https://toolkit.klaytn.foundation/misc/generateKeystore).

![Klaytn Online Toolkit](/img/references/keystore.png)

Download the keystore file, and let's change the name to something more simple, like `keystore.json`.

**You need KLAY to send a transaction.** You can get test KLAY for the Baobab testnet from [Faucet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.foundation/faucet). Refer to [Klaytn Wallet](../../../build/tools/wallets/klaytn-wallet.md#how-to-receive-baobab-testnet-klay) for detailed instructions.

## 2. Initialize Project <a id="2.-initialize-project"></a>

First, let's create a folder for our project. We will simply call it `test`. Navigate to your command line and type:

```
mkdir test
```

Now let's navigate to our folder.

```
cd test
```

We are in our folder, where we will download caver-js. But before that, we have to check our `node.js` version, because we have to use 12 or 14.

You can check the version like this:

```
node --version
```

If the version is not 12 or 14, **make sure to change it**. Here, we will use the version ([14.16.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/)). So let's type `nvm use 14.16.0` to change our node version.

Now let's initialize our project:

```
npm init
```

Since we are just doing a simple test, it doesn't matter how you answer the questions. Keep pressing `enter`.

```

package name: (test) 
version: (1.0.0) 
description: 
entry point: (index.js) 
test command: 
git repository: 
keywords: 
author: 
license: (ISC) 
About to write to /Users/terri.k/test/package.json:

{
  "name": "test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this OK? (yes)
```

Alternatively, you can simply type the command below to skip hitting `enter`:

```
npm init -y
```

## 3. Download caver-js <a id="3.-download-caver-js"></a>

And now we are ready to install caver-js.

```
npm install caver-js
```

Also, add the below module because we need it:

```
npm i read
```

## 4. Create Test File <a id="4.-create-test-file"></a>

Let's create a test file named `testcaver.js` like so:

```
touch testcaver.js
```

We will be writing our code in this file to send a transaction to transfer KLAY.

## 5. Connect to Klaytn Node <a id="5.-connect-to-klaytn-node"></a>

Since we are sending a transaction to the blockchain network, we need to connect to a Klaytn node. We will be using Klaytn's testnet Baobab.

We will import the `caver-js` and `read` module and connect to a Klaytn node in the Baobab network as shown below:

```javascript
const Caver = require('caver-js')
const read = require('read')
const caver = new Caver('https://public-en-baobab.klaytn.net/')
```

## 6. Provide Keystore, Create Keyring, and Add to Caver Wallet <a id="6.-add-keystore-create-keyring-and-add-to-caver-wallet"></a>

You need an account to make transactions on the blockchain. That account information is included in the keystore. Using the `loadPassword()` function, we can implement a password prompt on the terminal. The function looks like this:

```
async function loadPassword() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject)=> {
        read({ prompt: 'Password: ', silent: true }, function(er, password) {
            if(er) {
                reject(er)
                return
            }
            resolve(password)
        })

    })

}
```

The password entered from the prompt, along with the keystore file existing in the same directory, will be decrypted and stored as `keyring`.

After that, the `keyring` will be stored in the wallet. Add the lines below:

```
async function sendKlay() {
// Read keystore json file
  const fs = require('fs')
	const keystore = fs.readFileSync('./keystore.json', 'utf8')
	const password = await loadPassword()

	// Decrypt keystore and create
	const keyring = caver.wallet.keyring.decrypt(keystore, password)
	console.log(keyring)

    // Add to caver.wallet
	caver.wallet.add(keyring)

	}
```

## 7. Send Transaction <a id="7.-send-transaction"></a>

We will now create a transaction to transfer some KLAY. This type of transaction is called "value transfer transaction". Let's break down each parameter.

The `from` address is derived from the keystore we uploaded. The `to` address is the receiver of the KLAY, and you can use any address. For `value`, you can conveniently use `caver.utils.toPeb()` to convert KLAY into peb. Here, we will send 10 KLAY. For `gas`,

```
	
	// Create value transfer transaction
	const vt = caver.transaction.valueTransfer.create({
		from: keyring.address,
		to: '0x8084fed6b1847448c24692470fc3b2ed87f9eb47',
		value: caver.utils.toPeb(10, 'KLAY'),
		gas: 25000,
	})

	// Sign to the transaction
	const signed = await caver.wallet.sign(keyring.address, vt)

	// Send transaction to the Klaytn blockchain platform (Klaytn)
	const receipt = await caver.rpc.klay.sendRawTransaction(signed)
	console.log(receipt)
}
```

Don't forget to add in the end:

```
sendKlay()
```

## 8. Run the Code <a id="8.-run-the-code"></a>

Let's run the code that we've just written:

```
node testcaver.js
```

            resolve(password)
        })

    })

}

sendKLAY()
