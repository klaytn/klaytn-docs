# ERC-20

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

This tutorial helps you to create an example ERC-20 compatible token that conforms to the [Klaytn Token Standards](../token-standard.md), especially [Fungible Token Standard (ERC-20)](../token-standard.md#fungible-token-standard-kip-7).

[ERC-20 Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) defines two events and 9 methods (including 3 optional methods) as below. ERC-20-compatible tokens are token contracts that implements the following interface.

```text
function name() public view returns (string) //optional
function symbol() public view returns (string) //optional
function decimals() public view returns (uint8) //optional
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)

event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

Based on above interface, developers may customize tokens by adding new features and logics, and deploy on Klaytn network. For more information, refer to official [ERC-20 documentation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20).

In this tutorial, you are going to implement `MyERC20.sol`, an ERC-20 compatible token. This token will issue a predefined amount of tokens and sends all of the tokens to the contract owner on its deploy.

`MyERC20.sol` is based on OpenZeppelin's ERC20 implementation. A major part of the code in this tutorial is forked from [OpenZeppelin 2.3 ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/releases/tag/v2.3.0) and following Solidity files are used to implement `MyERC20.sol`.

### 1.1 Overall structure of MyERC20 <a id="1-1-overall-structure-of-myerc20"></a>

The complete source code of `MyERC20.sol` is given below. In this implementation, `constructor` invokes `_mint` to mint a predefined amount of token on contract deploy.

 * @dev Implementation of the `IERC20` interface.

 *
 * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See `IERC20.approve`.

`MyERC20.sol` consists of one interface `IERC20`, one library `SafeMath` and one contract `MyERC20` which implements `IERC20` interface.

- `IERC20` interface defines mandatory interface described at [ERC-20 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20).
- `SafeMath` library defines wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow checks for safe calculation of `uint256` type of Solidity.
- `MyERC20` implements `IERC20` interfaces and also defines three optional methods described at [ERC-20 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20).
  - In addition to ERC20, `constructor` is defined and this constructor is used to define a new ERC20 token name and symbol, and to mint a predefined amount of token. `constructor` is called once on its first deploy.

### 1.2 Take a look at important methods <a id="1-2-take-a-look-at-important-methods"></a>

Let's take a look at some important methods in detail.

#### (1) `function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);` <a id="1-function-balanceof-address-account-external-view-returns-uint256"></a>

`balanceOf` is a mandatory method of ERC-20. `balanceOf` returns the balance of the given address.

```text
    function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        return _balances[account];
    }
```

`balanceOf` just returns of value of key `account` stored in `_balances` which is `mapping (address => uint256)` type as below.

```text
    mapping (address => uint256) private _balances;
```

If there is no key `account` available in `_balances`, then it just returns `0`.

#### (2) `function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);` <a id="2-function-transfer-address-recipient-uint256-amount-external-returns-bool"></a>

`transfer` is a mandatory method of ERC-20. `transfer` transfers `amount` of tokens to `recipient`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event. The function SHOULD throw if the message caller’s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

`transfer` just invokes internal method `_transfer` which implements actual transfer and event as below.

```text
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        _transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

`_transfer` implements actual behavior of `transfer` method of ERC-20.

In addition, it prevents sending token from or to zero address using `require` as below.

```text
    function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(sender != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
        require(recipient != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");

        _balances[sender] = _balances[sender].sub(amount);
        _balances[recipient] = _balances[recipient].add(amount);
        emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    }
```

#### (3) `function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);` <a id="3-function-approve-address-spender-uint256-amount-external-returns-bool"></a>

`approve` is a mandatory method of ERC-20. `approve` allows `spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `amount`. If this function is called multiple times, it simply resets the allowance to `amount`.

`approve` just invokes internal method `_approve` which implements actual behavior of `approve`. `msg.sender` is passed as the account `owner`.

```text
    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {
        _approve(msg.sender, spender, value);
        return true;
    }

    function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        require(owner != address(0), "ERC20: approve from the zero address");
        require(spender != address(0), "ERC20: approve to the zero address");

        _allowances[owner][spender] = value;
        emit Approval(owner, spender, value);
    }
```

`_approve` updates `_allowances` which is a 2-dimensional dictionary maintaining allowed `value` for `spender` from specific `address`.

```text
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) private _allowances;
```

#### (4) `function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal` <a id="4-function-_mint-address-account-uint256-amount-internal"></a>

`_mint` is not part of ERC-20. However we need a way to create new ERC-20 tokens and introduced `_mint` to create new tokens in this implementation as below.

```text
    function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: mint to the zero address");

        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.add(amount);
        _balances[account] = _balances[account].add(amount);
        emit Transfer(address(0), account, amount);
    }
```

`_mint` is an internal method and can be invoked inside of this contract.

In `MyERC20.sol`, `_mint` is invoked only once from `constructor` when deploying the smart contract to mint a predefined amount of token.

If you want to issue additional tokens after deploying the smart contract, you have to introduce a new public method such as `mint`. The method should be implemented with CAUTION because only authorized users should be able to mint tokens.

Please take a look at OpenZeppelin example [ERC20Mintable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v2.3.0/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Mintable.sol) for more detail.

## 2. Deploying Smart Contract

You can use Remix Online IDE or use Truffle to deploy `MyERC20` smart contract.

### 2.1 Deploying smart contract using Remix Online IDE <a href="#2-1-deploying-smart-contract-using-klaytn-ide" id="2-1-deploying-smart-contract-using-klaytn-ide"></a>

- Please visit [Klaytn Plugin for Remix](https://ide.klaytn.foundation) and create a `MyERC20` contract. The complete source code was given at [Writing ERC-20 Smart Contract](#1-writing-erc-20-smart-contract).
- Prepare your account which will be used to deploy the contract.
  - If you do not have an account yet, create one at [https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.foundation/create](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.foundation/create) or [https://toolkit.klaytn.foundation/account/accountKeyLegacy](https://toolkit.klaytn.foundation/account/accountKeyLegacy).
  - Get some test KLAY from the faucet - [https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.foundation/faucet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.foundation/faucet)
- Let's deploy `MyERC20.sol` with the deploy parameters of `BAOBABTOKEN`, `BAO` and `8`.

![ERC20-1-deploy](/img/build/smart-contracts/erc20-1-deploy.png)

After deploying, you can invoke `balanceOf` with your account, which was used to deploy the contract. You will find there are `10000000000000` tokens available in your account as below. Because you set `decimal` as `8` when deploying the contract above, it minted a fixed number of `100000` tokens in the constructor, with one token having a decimal value of `10^8`. `totalSupply` method will return the total supply of tokens minted which should be also `10000000000000`.

![ERC20-2-owner-token](/img/build/smart-contracts/erc20-2-owner_token.png)
