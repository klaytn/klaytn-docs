# Orakl Network

## Introduction

![](/img/build/tools/klaytnXorakl.png)

[Orakl Network](https://docs.orakl.network) is a decentralized oracle network that allows smart contracts to securely access off-chain data and other resources. It prides itself in being a native token oracle that provides [Data Feed](https://docs.orakl.network/developers-guide/data-feed), [VRF](https://docs.orakl.network/developers-guide/vrf), [Request-Response](https://docs.orakl.network/developers-guide/request-response) and [Proof of Reserve](https://docs.orakl.network/developers-guide/proof-of-reserve) solutions.

With Orakl Network, users can  source for randomness that is unpredictable and unbiased in their smart contracts. Orakl Network [Verifiable Random Function (VRF)](https://docs.orakl.network/developers-guide/vrf#what-is-verifiable-random-function) allows smart contracts to generate verifiably random values, which can be used in various dApps that require randomness. Orakl Network provides developers access to the VRF services through two different account types, namely: [Permanent Account](https://docs.orakl.network/developers-guide/readme#permanent-account) or [Temporary Account](https://docs.orakl.network/developers-guide/readme#temporary-account).

In this tutorial, you will utilize the VRF functionality from Orakl Network to request for random words from inside of your smart contract.

## Prerequisites

- [Kaikas](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kaikas/jblndlipeogpafnldhgmapagcccfchpi?hl=en)
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [Klaytn Plugin on Remix](https://klaytn.foundation/using-klaytn-plugin-on-remix/)
- Test KLAY from [Faucet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.foundation/faucet)

## Getting Started

In the following steps, you will request for a random word in your smart contract using Orakl Network. Let's get started!

### Step 1: Initialize Contract State Variables

In this step, we will define the cosumer contract and initialize the state variables needed for our contract functionality. Our consumer contract is dependent on `VRFConsumerBase` contract from which we inherit, and `IVRFCoordinator` interface that is used for calls to `VRFCoordinator` contract. Next, we define `sRandomWord` variable which we use to store the random word result and the `sOwner` variable which is used inside of `onlyOwner` modifier.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

import { VRFConsumerBase } from "@bisonai/orakl-contracts/src/v0.1/VRFConsumerBase.sol";
import { IVRFCoordinator } from "@bisonai/orakl-contracts/src/v0.1/interfaces/IVRFCoordinator.sol";

contract VRFConsumer is VRFConsumerBase {
  uint256 public sRandomWord;
  address private sOwner;

  error OnlyOwner(address notOwner);
  modifier onlyOwner() {
      if (msg.sender != sOwner) {
          revert OnlyOwner(msg.sender);
      }
      _;
  }
```

### Step 2: Initialize VRF Coordinator

To request for random words in your smart contract, you need to initialize the [`VRFCoordinator`](https://github.com/Bisonai/orakl/blob/master/contracts-v0.1/src/v0.1/VRFCoordinator.sol) smart contract. It is recommended to bond `VRFCoordinator` interface with `VRFCoordinator` address supplied through a constructor parameter, and use it for random word requests (`requestRandomWords`). The `VRFCoordinator` contract is deployed both on Klaytn Baobab [0xDA8c0A00A372503aa6EC80f9b29Cc97C454bE499](https://baobab.klaytnfinder.io/account/0xDA8c0A00A372503aa6EC80f9b29Cc97C454bE499) and Klaytn Cypress [0x3F247f70DC083A2907B8E76635986fd09AA80EFb](https://www.klaytnfinder.io/account/0x3F247f70DC083A2907B8E76635986fd09AA80EFb).

```solidity
  IVRFCoordinator COORDINATOR;

  constructor(address coordinator) VRFConsumerBase(coordinator) {
      COORDINATOR = IVRFCoordinator(coordinator);
      sOwner = msg.sender;
  }
```

### Step 3: Request Random Words with Temporary Account

To request random words with a temporary account, users need to send $KLAY together with a call using value property.

```solidity
  function requestRandomWordsDirect(
      bytes32 keyHash,
      uint32 callbackGasLimit,
      uint32 numWords,
      address refundRecipient
  )
      public
      payable
      onlyOwner
      returns (uint256 requestId)
  {
    requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords{value: msg.value}(
      keyHash,
      callbackGasLimit,
      numWords,
      refundRecipient
    );
  }
```

This function calls the `requestRandomWords()` function defined in `COORDINATOR` contract, and passes `keyHash`, `callbackGasLimit`, `numWords` and `refundRecipient` as arguments. The payment for service is sent through `msg.value` to the `requestRandomWords()` in `COORDINATOR` contract. If the payment is larger than expected payment, exceeding payment is returned to the `refundRecipient` address. Eventually, it generates a request for random words. To accurately specify `msg.value` for the `requestRandomWords` function, please refer to the explanation on [how to estimate the service fee](https://docs.orakl.network/developers-guide/vrf#get-estimated-service-fee).

### Step 4: Fulfill Random Words

The `fulfillRandomWords` function is called by `VRFCoordinator` contract when fulfilling the random words request.

```solidity
function fulfillRandomWords(
    uint256 /* requestId */,
    uint256[] memory randomWords
)
    internal
    override
{
    // requestId should be checked if it matches the expected request
    // Generate random value between 1 and 50.
    sRandomWord = (randomWords[0] % 50) + 1;
}
```

Now that we have the Orakl VRF solution code, letâ€™s get to see it in action.

## Practical Implementation

In the example below, the contract allows us to request for random words and receive its fulfillment.

### Create and Deploy Sample Code

**Remix IDE**

- Navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

import {VRFConsumerBase} from "@bisonai/orakl-contracts/src/v0.1/VRFConsumerBase.sol";
import {IVRFCoordinator} from "@bisonai/orakl-contracts/src/v0.1/interfaces/IVRFCoordinator.sol";

contract VRFConsumer is VRFConsumerBase {
    uint256 public sRandomWord;
    address private sOwner;

    IVRFCoordinator COORDINATOR;

    error OnlyOwner(address notOwner);

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        if (msg.sender != sOwner) {
            revert OnlyOwner(msg.sender);
        }
        _;
    }

    constructor(address coordinator) VRFConsumerBase(coordinator) {
        sOwner = msg.sender;
        COORDINATOR = IVRFCoordinator(coordinator);
    }

    function requestRandomWordsDirect(
        bytes32 keyHash,
        uint32 callbackGasLimit,
        uint32 numWords,
        address refundRecipient
    ) public payable onlyOwner returns (uint256 requestId) {
        requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords{value: msg.value}(
            keyHash,
            callbackGasLimit,
            numWords,
            refundRecipient
        );
    }

    function fulfillRandomWords(
        uint256 /* requestId */,
        uint256[] memory randomWords
    ) internal override {
        // requestId should be checked if it matches the expected request
        // Generate random value between 1 and 50.
        sRandomWord = (randomWords[0] % 50) + 1;
    }
}
```

### Interact with Smart Contract

To request for random words in your smart contract, you have to first execute the `requestRandomWordsDirect()` function. For this function to successfully execute, the user has to send KLAY (minimum of 1 KLAY) as stated previously, and supply `keyHash`, `callbackGasLimit`, `numWords`, and `refundRecipient` parameters. `keyHash` parameter uniquely defines who can fulfill the request. Orakl Network VRF provides one key hash for each Klaytn chain:

- Baobab: `0xd9af33106d664a53cb9946df5cd81a30695f5b72224ee64e798b278af812779c`
- Cypress: `0x6cff5233743b3c0321a19ae11ab38ae0ddc7ddfe1e91b162fa8bb657488fb157`

For the rest of the parameters, you can set them as follows:

- `callbackGasLimit` as `500000`,
- `numWords` as `1`, and
- set `refundRecipient` to your EOA address.

Afterwards, once the request has been fulfilled, the `sRandomWord()` function can be executed. This `sRandomWord()` function returns the random word.

- **requestRandomWordsDirect()**: Will be sending 1 KLAY to execute this function. The image below illustrate this:

![](/img/build/tools/orakl-vrf-request.png)

- **sRandomWord()**: After the `VRFCoordinator` has fulfilled the random word request, the response is stored in the `sRandomWord` variable. To get the response, call the `sRandomWord()` function.

Tada ðŸŽ‰! You just requested for a random word and received one in your smart contract.
