# Cross-chain

Cross-chain messaging protocols seek to connect chains that are originally isolated and independent together, hence making them interoperable to the point of moving liquidity and state between themselves. These protocols set the rules and processes for transferring assets between different blockchain networks. Multiple blockchains may now interact, collaborate, and exchange data with ease between their independent systems thanks to cross-chain messaging protocols, which made it possible.

The cross-chain messaging protocols that are compatible with the Klaytn network are listed below.
