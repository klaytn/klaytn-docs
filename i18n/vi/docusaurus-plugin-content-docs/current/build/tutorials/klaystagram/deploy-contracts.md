## 2. Write Klaystagram Smart Contract <a id="4-write-klaystagram-smart-contract"></a>

1. Background
2. Contract setup
3. Set events and data structure
4. Write functions \
   4.1. `uploadPhoto`\
   4.2. `transferOwnership`\
   4.3. `getPhoto`

### 1) Background <a id="1-background"></a>

We will make a simple contract called "Klaystagram".

- `PhotoData` struct is defined to store various photo data.
- User can upload photo and transfer the ownership photo via `uploadPhoto` and `transferOwnership` functions.

### 2) Contract setup <a id="2-contract-setup"></a>

- Specify solidity version. We recommend using 0.5.6 stable version.
- We will make use of ERC721 standard to build non-fungible tokens.
  - Import `ERC721.sol` and `ERC721Enumerable.sol`
  - Check out detailed information about ERC721 at [erc721.org](http://erc721.org)

```text
pragma solidity 0.5.6;

import "./ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "./ERC721/ERC721Enumerable.sol";

contract Klaystagram is ERC721, ERC721Enumerable {
```

### 3) Set events and data structure <a id="3-set-events-and-data-structure"></a>

We need to set up an event to keep track of activities on blockchain.

As for data structure, mapping `_photoList` takes a uint256 `tokenId` to map a specific `PhotoData` struct. By defining PhotoUploaded event, transaction receipt will log this event whenever function containing this is called.

```text
event PhotoUploaded (uint indexed tokenId, bytes photo, string title, string location, string description, uint256 timestamp);

mapping (uint256 => PhotoData) private _photoList;

struct PhotoData {
    uint256 tokenId;                       // Unique token id, starts from 1 and increases by 1
    address[] ownerHistory;                // History of all previous owners
    bytes photo;                           // Image source
    string title;                          // Title of photo
    string location;                       // Location where photo is taken
    string description;                    // Short description about the photo
    uint256 timestamp;                     // Uploaded time
}
```

### 4) Write functions <a id="4-write-functions"></a>

Let's write some functions that interact with the contract. In this tutorial let us only consider two functions: `uploadPhoto` and `transferOwnership`. Check out Klaystagram.sol to see the whole set of functions.

#### 4-1) `uploadPhoto` <a id="4-1-uploadphoto"></a>

`uploadPhoto` function takes 4 arguments including photo's image source. To keep things simple, `tokenId` will start from 1 and will increase by 1.

`_mint` function is from ERC721 contract. It creates a new token and assign it to a specific address, which in this case, `msg.sender`. In this application, logged in user will create transaction with their own private key. So `msg.sender` will be the user's public address.

Finally, initialize `PhotoData` struct, locate it inside `_photoList` mapping, and push the owner address into `ownerHistory` array. And don't forget to emit the event we just created. As mentioned above, this event will be included in transaction receipt.

```text
function uploadPhoto(bytes memory photo, string memory title, string memory location, string memory description) public {
    uint256 tokenId = totalSupply() + 1;

    _mint(msg.sender, tokenId);

    address[] memory ownerHistory;

    PhotoData memory newPhotoData = PhotoData({
        tokenId : tokenId,
        ownerHistory : ownerHistory,
        photo : photo,
        title: title,
        location : location,
        description : description,
        timestamp : now
    });

    _photoList[tokenId] = newPhotoData;
    _photoList[tokenId].ownerHistory.push(msg.sender);

    emit PhotoUploaded(tokenId, photo, title, location, description, now);
}
```

#### 4-2) `transferOwnership` <a id="4-2-transferownership"></a>

Let's take a look at `transferOwnership` function. When transferring photo ownership, we need to do two things. First, we have to reassign the owner, and then we have to push new owner address into `ownerHistory` array.

To do this, `transferOwnership` first calls `safeTransferFrom` function from ERC721 standard, which eventually calls `transferFrom` function. As mentioned above, right after token transfer is successfully done, we have to push new owner information into `ownerHistory` array, and that is exactly why `transferFrom` is overridden as below.

```text
/**
  * @notice safeTransferFrom function checks whether receiver is able to handle ERC721 tokens,
  *  thus less possibility of tokens being lost. After checking is done, it will call transferFrom function defined below
  */
function transferOwnership(uint256 tokenId, address to) public returns(uint, address, address, address) {
    safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, to, tokenId);
    uint ownerHistoryLength = _photoList[tokenId].ownerHistory.length;
    return (
        _photoList[tokenId].tokenId,
        //original owner
        _photoList[tokenId].ownerHistory[0],
        //previous owner, length cannot be less than 2
        _photoList[tokenId].ownerHistory[ownerHistoryLength-2],
        //current owner
        _photoList[tokenId].ownerHistory[ownerHistoryLength-1]);
}

/**
  * @notice Recommend using transferOwnership, which uses safeTransferFrom function
  * @dev Override transferFrom function to make sure that every time ownership transfers
  *  new owner address gets pushed into ownerHistory array
  */
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
    super.transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);
    _photoList[tokenId].ownerHistory.push(to);
}
```

#### 4-3) `getPhoto` <a id="4-3-getphoto"></a>

Finally, let's make a getter function that fetches data stored in the smart contract. By calling a single function, we want to fetch every information regarding a specific photo. So `getPhoto` function takes an index(token id) as an argument and returns every element in PhotoData struct.

```text
function getPhoto(uint tokenId) public view
returns(uint256, address[] memory, bytes memory, string memory, string memory, string memory, uint256) {
    require(_photoList[tokenId].tokenId != 0, "Photo does not exist");
    return (
        _photoList[tokenId].tokenId,
        _photoList[tokenId].ownerHistory,
        _photoList[tokenId].photo,
        _photoList[tokenId].title,
        _photoList[tokenId].location,
        _photoList[tokenId].description,
        _photoList[tokenId].timestamp);
}
```

This is it, now we can deploy this contract!

## 3. Deploy Contract <a href="#3.-deploy-contract" id="3.-deploy-contract"></a>

1. Get some testnet KLAY to deploy contract
2. Truffle configuration
3. Deploy setup (select contract which you want to deploy)
4. Deploy

### 1) Get some KLAY <a href="#1-get-some-klay" id="1-get-some-klay"></a>

To deploy contract, we need some KLAY in your account to pay for gas price. You can get 150 KLAY via Klaytn Wallet in the testnet.

1. Create your Klaytn account at [Baobab Klaytn Wallet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.foundation/create) -> `PRIVATE KEY` will be used in truffle configuration. So copy it down somewhere

2. After creating your Klaytn account, run faucet to receive 5 Baobab testnet KLAY in [Baobab Klaytn Faucet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.foundation/faucet)

![create-account & run-klay-faucet](/img/build/tutorials/klaystagram-run-faucet.png)

### 2. truffle configuration <a href="#2-truffle-configuration" id="2-truffle-configuration"></a>

`truffle-config.js` is a configuration file including deployment configuration. We are going to deploy our contract using `Private key` we've just created in the previous step. Paste your `Private key` that has enough KLAY to truffle-config.js

_WARNING: You shouldn't expose your private key. Otherwise, your account would be hacked._

```javascript
// truffle-config.js

const HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider-klaytn");

/**
 * truffle network variables
 * for deploying contract to klaytn network.
 */
const NETWORK_ID = '1001'

/**
 * URL: URL for the remote node you will be using
 * PRIVATE_KEY: Private key of the account that pays for the transaction (Change it to your own private key)
 */
const URL = 'https://public-en-baobab.klaytn.net'

// Paste your `Private key` that has enough KLAY to truffle.js
const PRIVATE_KEY = 'your_private_key'

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    klaytn: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(PRIVATE_KEY, URL),
      network_id: NETWORK_ID,
      gas: '8500000',
      gasPrice: null,
    },
  },

  // Specify the version of compiler, we use 0.5.6
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: '0.5.6',
    },
  },
}
```

#### `networks` property <a href="#networks-property" id="networks-property"></a>

See `networks` property above. `klaytn` network has 4 properties,\
`provider`, `network_id`, `gas`, `gasPrice`.

- `provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(PRIVATE_KEY, URL)` Just as the name indicates, it injects private key and url defined above.
- `network_id: NETWORK_ID` Specify network id in Klaytn, you should set it to `1001` to use Klaytn Baobab network (testnet).
- `gas: GASLIMIT` Maximum gas you are willing to spend.
- `gasPrice: null` This is price per every gas unit. Currently in Klaytn, the gas price is fixed to `'25000000000'`. By setting it to `null`, truffle will automatically set the gas price.

#### `compiler` property <a href="#compiler-property" id="compiler-property"></a>

Remember that for Solidity contract we used version 0.5.6, thus specify compiler version here.

### 3. Deployment setup <a href="#3-deployment-setup" id="3-deployment-setup"></a>

`migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js`:

```javascript
const Klaystagram = artifacts.require('./Klaystagram.sol')
const fs = require('fs')

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(Klaystagram)
    .then(() => {
    if (Klaystagram._json) {
      // 1. Record recently deployed contract's abi file to 'deployedABI'
      fs.writeFile(
        'deployedABI',
        JSON.stringify(Klaystagram._json.abi, 2),
        (err) => {
          if (err) throw err
          console.log(`The abi of ${Klaystagram._json.contractName} is recorded on deployedABI file`)
        })
    }

    // 2. Record recently deployed contract's address to 'deployedAddress'
    fs.writeFile(
      'deployedAddress',
      Klaystagram.address,
      (err) => {
        if (err) throw err
        console.log(`The deployed contract address * ${Klaystagram.address} * is recorded on deployedAddress file`)
    })
  })
}
```

You can specify which contract code will you deploy in your `contracts/` directory.

1. Import your contract file (`Klaystagram.sol`) via

   `const Klaystagram = artifacts.require('./Klaystagram.sol')`
2. Use `deployer` to deploy your contract, `deployer.deploy(Klaystagram)`.
3. If you want to add more logic after deploying your contract, use `.then()` (optional)
4. To save contracts' `deployedABI` and `deployedAddress`, use `fs` node.js module

   `fs.writeFile(filename, content, callback)` (optional)

cf. For further information about `artifacts.require()`, refer to truffle official documentation at [truffle docs](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations#artifacts-require-)

### 4. Deploy <a href="#4-deploy" id="4-deploy"></a>

![deploy contract](/img/build/tutorials/klaystagram-deploy-contract.png)

In your terminal type `$ truffle deploy --network baobab`.\
It will deploy your contract according to `truffle-config.js` and `migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js` configuration.

Terminal will display deployed contract address if deployment was successful.

cf) `--reset` option\
If you provide this option, truffle will recompile and redeploy your contract even if contracts haven't changed.\
ex) `$ truffle deploy --reset --network baobab`

## 4. Run App

[![Klaystagram Introduction Video](/img/build/tutorials/klaystagram-video-poster.png)](https://vimeo.com/327033594)
