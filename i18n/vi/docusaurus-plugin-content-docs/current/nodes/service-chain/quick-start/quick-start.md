# Quick Start

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a ServiceChain network and connecting it to the Klaytn Baobab network.
You will also learn how to enable periodic anchoring and cross-chain value transfer.
In order to operate the actual blockchain services with the ServiceChain, we will explain High Availability, building a ServiceChain hierarchically, and value transfer between sibling ServiceChains.
