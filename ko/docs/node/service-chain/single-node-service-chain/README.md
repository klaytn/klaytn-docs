# Single-Node Service Chain

This chapter covers how to set up the simplest form of service chain.

You will install a single Service Chain Node (SCN) that will act as a proprietary blockchain network handling your application's transaction requests and creating blocks.

Then, you will connect the SCN to the main chain by enabling an EN's main bridge. SCN will periodically send anchoring transactions to the main chain via EN.
