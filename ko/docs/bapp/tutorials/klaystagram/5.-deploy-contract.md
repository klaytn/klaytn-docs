# 5. Deploy Contract

1\) Get some testnet KLAY to deploy contract  
2\) Truffle configuration  
3\) Deploy setup \(select contract which you want to deploy\)  
4\) Deploy

## 1\) Get some KLAY

To deploy contract, we need some KLAY in your account to pay for gas price. You can get 5 KLAY via Klaytn Wallet in the testnet. 1. Create your Klaytn account at [Baobab Klaytn Wallet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.com/create) -&gt; `PRIVATE KEY` will be used in truffle configuration. So copy it down somewhere 2. After creating your Klaytn account, run faucet to receive 5 Baobab testnet KLAY in [Baobab Klaytn Faucet](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.com/faucet)

## 2\) truffle configuration

`truffle-config.js` is a configuration file including deployment configuration. We are going to deploy our contract using `Private key` we've just created in the previous step. Paste your `Private key` that has enough KLAY to truffle-config.js

*WARNING: You shouldn't expose your private key. Otherwise, your account would be hacked.*

```javascript
// truffle-config.js

const HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider-klaytn");

/**
 * truffle network variables
 * for deploying contract to klaytn network.
 */
const NETWORK_ID = '1001'

/**
 * URL: URL for the remote node you will be using
 * PRIVATE_KEY: Private key of the account that pays for the transaction (Change it to your own private key)
 */
const URL = 'https://api.baobab.klaytn.net:8651'

// Paste your `Private key` that has enough KLAY to truffle.js
const PRIVATE_KEY = '0x3de0c90ce7e440f19eff6439390c29389f611725422b79c95f9f48c856b58277'

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    baobab: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(PRIVATE_KEY, URL),
      network_id: NETWORK_ID,
      gas: '8500000',
      gasPrice: null,
    },
  },

  // Specify the version of compiler, we use 0.4.24
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: '0.4.24',
    },
  },
}
```

### `networks` property

See `networks` property above. `klaytn` network has 4 properties,  
`provider`, `network_id`, `gas`, `gasPrice`.

* `provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(PRIVATE_KEY, URL)` Just as the name indicates, it injects private key and url defined above.
* `network_id: NETWORK_ID` Specify network id in Klaytn, you should set it to `1001` to use Klaytn Baobab network \(testnet\).
* `gas: GASLIMIT` Maximum gas you are willing to spend.
* `gasPrice: null` This is price per every gas unit. Currently in Klaytn, the gas price is fixed to `'25000000000'`. By setting it to `null`, truffle will automatically set the gas price.

### `compiler` property

Remember that for Solidity contract we used version 0.4.24, thus specify compiler version here.

## 3\) Deployment setup

`migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js`:

```javascript
const Klaystagram = artifacts.require('./Klaystagram.sol')
const fs = require('fs')

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(Klaystagram)
    .then(() => {
    if (Klaystagram._json) {
      // 1. Record recently deployed contract's abi file to 'deployedABI'
      fs.writeFile(
        'deployedABI',
        JSON.stringify(Klaystagram._json.abi, 2),
        (err) => {
          if (err) throw err
          console.log(`The abi of ${Klaystagram._json.contractName} is recorded on deployedABI file`)
        })
    }

    // 2. Record recently deployed contract's address to 'deployedAddress'
    fs.writeFile(
      'deployedAddress',
      Klaystagram.address,
      (err) => {
        if (err) throw err
        console.log(`The deployed contract address * ${Klaystagram.address} * is recorded on deployedAddress file`)
    })
  })
}
```

You can specify which contract code will you deploy in your `contracts/` directory.

1. Import your contract file \(`Klaystagram.sol`\) via
    
    `const Klaystagram = artifacts.require('./Klaystagram.sol')`

2. Use `deployer` to deploy your contract, `deployer.deploy(Klaystagram)`.

3. If you want to add more logic after deploying your contract, use `.then()` \(optional\) 
4. To save contracts' `deployedABI` and `deployedAddress`, use `fs` node.js module
    
    `fs.writeFile(filename, content, callback)` \(optional\)

cf. For further information about `artifacts.require()`, refer to truffle official documentation at [truffle docs](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations#artifacts-require-.)

## 4\) Deploy

![deploy contract](images/klaystagram-deploy-contract.png)

In your terminal type `$ truffle deploy --network baobab`.  
It will deploy your contract according to `truffle-config.js` and `migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js` configuration.

Terminal will display deployed contract address if deployment was successful.

cf\) `--reset` option  
If you provide this option, truffle will recompile and redeploy your contract even if contracts haven't changed.  
ex\) `$ truffle deploy --reset --network klaytn`
