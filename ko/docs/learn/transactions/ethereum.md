# Ethereum Compatibility

Klaytn provides wrapped transaction types to support Ethereum compatibility. Ethereum transaction types in Klaytn have the same attributes and RLP encoding schemes with Ethereum's design except for the single-byte type delimiter called `EthereumTxTypeEnvelope`. Therefore, users can successfully deploy transactions generated by Ethereum development tools on Klaytn. The type delimiter is also omitted when users use `eth` namespace APIs, so they can use Klaytn just as if they were using Ethereum. Using `klay` namespace APIs, users can deploy and retrieve Ethereum formatted transactions as a type of Klaytn transactions without getting confused with the existing Klaytn transaction types.

## EthereumTxTypeEnvelope <a id="ethereumtxtypeenvelope"></a>

EthereumTxTypeEnvelope is a single-byte prefix for raw transactions that denotes Ethereum transaction types. Ethereum has adopted an extendable transaction type scheme from [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) and it uses a type numbering system that conflicts with Klaytn's. To resolve the conflict between two different transaction type schemes, Klaytn has introduced `EthereumTxTypeEnvelope` which allows for separation and expansion for future Ethereum transaction types.

`EthereumTxTypeEnvelope` is an additional type delimiter and used only for raw transactions and type numbering. It is not used for transaction hash or signature hash. For that purpose, `EthereumTransactionType` as defined in EIPs is used.

- EthereumTxTypeEnvelope: `0x78`
- TxHashRLP : EthereumTransactionType || TransactionPayload
- RawTransaction : EthereumTxTypeEnvelope || EthereumTransactionType || TransactionPayload

## TxTypeEthereumAccessList <a id="txtypeethereumaccesslist"></a>

`TxTypeEthereumAccessList` represents a type of Ethereum transaction specified in [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930). This transactions type contains an access list, a list of addresses and storage keys that the transaction is supposed to access. Since this transaction type exists to support compatibility, it only works with EOAs associated with [AccountKeyLegacy]. EOAs associated with other account key types should use other transaction types such as `TxTypeValueTransfer`, `TxTypeSmartContractExecution`, and so on. This transaction type can create accounts, transfer tokens, deploy/execute smart contracts or a mix of the aforementioned.

:::note

Klaytn networks can process this transaction type after the `EthTxTypeCompatibleBlock`

:::

:::note

NOTE: This transaction type only supports the format of the Ethereum transaction type. Unlike [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930), there are no benefits in terms of transaction fee from using access list.

### RLP Encoding for Signature <a id="rlp-encoding-for-signature"></a>

To make a signature for this transaction type, the RLP serialization proceeds as follows:

:::note

This type of transaction should be signed with London Signer

:::

```javascript
SigRLP = EthereumTransactionType || encode([chainId, nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList])
SigHash = keccak256(SigRLP)
Signature = sign(SigHash, <private key>)
```

### RLP Encoding for SenderTxHash <a id="rlp-encoding-for-sendertxhash"></a>

To obtain `SenderTxHash` for this transaction type, the RLP serialization proceeds as follows:

```javascript
SenderTxHashRLP = EthereumTransactionType || encode([chainId, nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, v, r, s])
SenderTxHash = keccak256(SenderTxHashRLP)
Signature = sign(SenderTxHash, <private key>)
```

### RLP Encoding for Transaction Hash <a id="rlp-encoding-for-transaction-hash"></a>

To make a transaction hash, the RLP serialization proceeds as follows:

```javascript
TxHashRLP = EthereumTransactionType || encode([chainId, nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, v, r, s])
TxHash = keccak256(TxHashRLP)
```

### Raw Transaction <a id="raw-transaction"></a>

```javascript
RawTx = EthereumTxTypeEnvelope || EthereumTransactionType || encode([chainId, nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, v, r, s])
```

## TxTypeEthereumDynamicFee <a id="txtypeethereumdynamicfee"></a>

`TxTypeEthereumDynamicFee` represents a type of Ethereum transaction specified in [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559). This transaction type contains `gasTipCap` and `gasFeeCap` instead of `gasPrice`. Since this transaction type exists to support compatibility, it only works with EOAs associated with [AccountKeyLegacy]. EOAs associated with other account key types should use other transaction types such as `TxTypeValueTransfer`, `TxTypeSmartContractExecution`, and so on. This type of transaction can create accouns, transfer tokens, deploy/execute smart contracts, or a mix of the aforementioned.

:::note

NOTE: Klaytn networks can process this transaction type after the `EthTxTypeCompatibleBlock`

:::

:::note

Currently, this type of transaction only supports the format of the Ethereum transaction type. Unlike [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930), there are no benefits in terms of transaction fees from using access list.

:::

:::note

NOTE: Since Klaytn has a fixed gas price, `gasTipCap` and `gasFeeCap` should take the gas price for the respective network, which is 250 ston at the time of writing.

### RLP Encoding for Signature <a id="rlp-encoding-for-signature"></a>

To make a signature for this transaction type, the RLP serialization proceeds as follows:

:::note

This type of transaction should be signed with London Signer

:::

```javascript
SigRLP = EthereumTransactionType || encode([chainId, nonce, gasTipCap, gasFeeCap, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList])
SigHash = keccak256(SigRLP)
Signature = sign(SigHash, <private key>)
```

### RLP Encoding for SenderTxHash <a id="rlp-encoding-for-sendertxhash"></a>

To obtain `SenderTxHash` for this transaction type, the RLP serialization proceeds as follows:

```javascript
SenderTxHashRLP = EthereumTransactionType || encode([chainId, nonce, gasTipCap, gasFeeCap, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, v, r, s])
SenderTxHash = keccak256(SenderTxHashRLP)
Signature = sign(SenderTxHash, <private key>)
```

### RLP Encoding for Transaction Hash <a id="rlp-encoding-for-transaction-hash"></a>

To obtain a transaction hash, the RLP serialization proceeds as follows:

```javascript
TxHashRLP = EthereumTransactionType || encode([chainId, nonce, gasTipCap, gasFeeCap, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, v, r, s])
TxHash = keccak256(TxHashRLP)
```

### Raw Transaction <a id="raw-transaction"></a>

```javascript
RawTx = EthereumTxTypeEnvelope || EthereumTransactionType || encode([chainId, nonce, gasTipCap, gasFeeCap, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, v, r, s])
```
