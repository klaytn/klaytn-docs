### Write clearly and accurately

Use clear language, while maintaining technical accuracy. Replace technical jargons with simpler words.

### Be aware of your audience

Always consider Klaytn users' needs and help them complete processes quickly and easily. Do this by including all steps in procedures, suggesting best practices, and including tips and other types of notes.

### Get to the point

Provide relevant content without being wordy. Avoid repeating details in a single topic.

### Be consistent

Use the same terminology, formatting, voice, and tone.

### Include everyone

All people are welcome here. Use appropriate language as it relates to matters of identity.

## Style guidelines

Generally, we abide by the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) because it shares our goal of creating clear and useful content. However, we don't follow every rule, and, in some cases, we break the rules in favor of our own.

Here are some of the more important guidelines we use. If you follow at least these guidelines, your content will begin to resemble other parts of the documentation, making a consistent experience for Terra users.

### Acronyms

Use the spelled-out term followed by the acronym in parentheses, such as Governance Council (GC). Use only the acronym for subsequent occurrences in the same topic. 

### Sentence case

Use sentence-style capitalization in all levels of headings.

### Verb tense

Use the present tense and active voice.

### Klaytn conventions

- KLAY is always capitalized. There is no plural form. (2 KLAY)
- Klaytn is written in sentence case.
